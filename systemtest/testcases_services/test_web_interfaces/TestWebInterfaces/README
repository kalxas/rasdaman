This is a Java application to test WS-Client and SECORE user interfaces. 
It uses Selenium and Firefox (geckodriver) to run a headless Web Browser and can imitate 
user's behavior by clicking on the buttons of test cases which belong to web pages. 
It cannot test WebWorldWind because WebGL is not supported by Selenium.

When a test case finishes, it captures the web page as an output image file and
compares with an oracle image file. The similarity is set to 95% because some test cases (e.g: WCPS console)
have the response times of queries and the output files are slightly different on each run.

To add/update test cases:
1. Modify an existing class which represents these test cases (e.g: class WCSDeleteCoverageTest is used to test the DeleteCoverage feature from WCS-Client)
2. If a class does not exist, create a new class for it.

To add oracle files:
- Add the test cases in test class and run test application. It will create oracle file if it does not exist yet.

NOTE: 
- This Java application needs 2 command-line parameters (petascope and secore ports) from the conf/test.cfg file. They are passed from the test script (../test.sh) when the system test runs.
- It also requires phantomjs binary file which is downloaded by the test script (../test.sh) and copied to src/main/resources directory.
