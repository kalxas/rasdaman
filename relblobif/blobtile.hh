/*@Doc:

BLOBTile is the persistent class for storing the contents of MDD tiles
in the database. Each instance represents the contents of a tile of a MDD Object
from the database. BLOBTiles are just arrays of unsigned characters.
In main memory they are encapsulated in the class \Ref{PersTile}.

At the moment a BLOBTile is loaded into main memory, when it is
accessed the first time. This usually happens, when the RasDaMan DBMS
accesses the contents of a \Ref{PersTile}.

{\bf Interdependencies}

BLOBTile is an interface class with the base DBMS. It is, therefore,
highly dependent on the base DBMS used.
