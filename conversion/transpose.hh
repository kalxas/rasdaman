//implementation and make it more transparent
//in the future, one should improve upon the transpose function so that it will
//ensure the indices are valid dimensions and if they are, transpose those two
//axes regardless of whether or not they are the last two. This would require
//either a cumbersome memory computation, a vacancy tracking algorithm, or
//a bit map to implement effectively. For now, we only need this for pictures,
//and as such, transposeLastTwo is good enough for the time being.
