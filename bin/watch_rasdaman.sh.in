#
# SYNOPSIS
#    watch_rasdaman.sh
# Description
#    This script can be run in the background (as a cron job to check rasdaman's status and restart it if it is necessary for example).
#    Rasdaman is restarted by executing stop_rasdaman.sh and start_rasdaman.sh (or systemctl restart rasdaman if applicable).
#    It will check petascope's status and if it detects that it is down it will restart Tomcat (systemctl restart tomcat).
#    Users need to change this script for the corresponding system (e.g: Ubuntu: service tomcat start, CentOs: systemctl start tomcat)
#    or if a servlet container different from Tomcat is used for deploying the rasdaman web services.
