/*@Doc:

The user specifies types as strings. This is passed down to the
TypeFactory where according to the string the object representing
the type is read from the database. The base DBMS manages
persistent objects for all base types. Pointers to these
persistent objects are returned if #mapType# is called. In the
current implementation, these pointers get invalid after a
transaction is committed. So the user has to call #mapType# again
after a commit(most programs do this anyway).

The name of the type used for accessing it is the class name without
the Type suffix. e.g. "Bool" for \Ref{BoolType} or "ULong" for
\Ref{ULongType}.

Only one instance of TypeFactory exists at any time. Also only one
instance of the types exits in memory. The pointers returned
should not be freed, the memory is freed, when the TypeFactory is
destroyed. The static member function can also be called directly
with the scope operator. The class follows the singleton design
pattern(Gamma et. al. S. 127ff.) and the builder design pattern
(Gamma et. al.  S. 97ff.).

{\bf Functionality}

Returns a pointer to \Ref{BaseType} to the type which is identified by
a string.

{\bf Interdependencies}

Will be used from \Ref{MDDObject} and subclasses when created.
Because all types are stored persistently, it is necessary to open
a session using AdminIf::instance()(see \Ref{AdminIf}), a
database using DatabaseIf::open()(see \Ref{DatabaseIf) and a
transaction using TransactionIf::begin(see \Ref{TransactionIf)
before creating instances of types with mapType().
