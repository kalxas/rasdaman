/*@Doc:

The regular computed index uses DBRCIndexDS and StorageLayout to store its persistent data.
The point is:
    The tiles all have the same layout.
    The domain of the mdd is fixed.
With those preliminaries it is possible to speed up the index considerably.
DBRCIndexDS stores the domain of the mdd object, the first OIdCounter and the OIdType of the entries.
The storage layout stores the tile configuration.

An algorithm computes the oid of a tile using the complete domain and the tile configuration.

The number of allocated oids has to be stored in the DBRCIndexDS because the DBRCIndexDS has to delete
all tiles belonging to it without information on the tile configuration (an hence cannot compute its
size).
