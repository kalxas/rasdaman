/*@Doc:

    The SDirIndexLogic class implements a Directory of Interval Objects Index.

    Objects inserted in the index must be disjunctive, since optimizations
    are made which assume nonoverlapping interval objects.

    It can be used as index on tiles of MDD objects.
    A directory index consists solely of the current domain and
    a list of entries, one for each interval object (for instance, a tile).
    Interval objects must not overlap, since <tt>SDirIndexLogic</tt> optimizes access
    based on the assumption that entries don't overlap. Entries are
    sorted by the lower vertice.
    Each entry contains the interval domain and a reference to the object
    itself.

    SDirIndexLogic implements the higher level index functionality and uses the
    functionality of <tt>IndexDS</tt> to do the operations.

    This way, <tt>SDirIndexLogic</tt> can be used for both persistent or
    main memory indexes, tiles index or intermediate nodes of a multidimensional
    index, etc, by defining appropriate <tt>IndexDS</tt> classes. Examples are
    <tt>TransDirIx</tt> and <tt>DBHierIndex</tt>, for transient and persistent
    indexes, respectively.A

    The logic classes are stack based for performance and memory reasons -> everything is static.
