/*@Doc:

Each MDD Object is composed of a set of tiles which are accessed through an
index. The task of the index is to determine the tiles affected by a spatial
operation and to allow fast access to them. It will also take care of memory
management of the tiles.

MDD Objects indexes are multidimensional since they provide access to
multidimensional rectangular tiles existing in multidimensional intervals. An
MDDObjIx has to be able to deal with different dimensionalities.

The index of an MDD object keeps the information about the current domain of
the MDD object. During the lifetime of the object, it is possible that the
definition (or current) domain of an object is not completely covered by the
tiles already inserted. At each moment, the current domain of an object is the
closure of the domains of all tiles. All tiles should be completely contained
in the definition domain of an object. The definition domain may have open
boundaries, but the current domain is always a closed interval.

The lower classes in the indexmgr support storage of any kind of persistent
object. This class has to be changed to reflect this ability.

In the future, functions have to be implemented which allow the user to
give indication about priorities for freeing tiles from main memory.

        Internal cache of <tt>Tile</tt>s accessed the last time.
        Contents change everytime there is an insert, an intersect, a getTiles
        or a poin query, in the following way:
        - insert: cache invalid, last Access is put to empty interval,
            lastAccessTiles contains the inserted tiles. This is needed
            if we want the index to automatically manage the memory
            allocated for persistent tiles or else the just inserted
            tiles are immediately invalid for the user after insertion
            in the object. The lastAccess can not be put to the area
            because it's impossible to determine the area corresponding
            to inserted tiles (there may be empty areas and so on, it
            would be rather complex to calculate these things).
        - intersect/pointquery: cache and lastAccessTiles get the new result.
                    The old access and tiles are thrown away.
        - getTiles: it would be very inefficient to search here for smaller
                regions, so lastAccess is made empty and lastAccessTiles
                contains the tiles accessed (because of PersTiles and
                automatic management of their memory, they have to be
                kept by the MDDObjIx).
        For this reason, tiles passed by PersMDDObj are only valid until the
        next intersect/pointQuery/insert/getTiles operation.
        Alternative implementation for getTiles - always put in the cache
        correctly.
        Make a check about the search interval and what is in the cache (for
        example, if cell_count < 90% cache cell count , access index).
        Such a check should also be done in lastAccessPointQuery(): if the
        cache has more than 10 elements, it is not worth searching in it for
        a point.
