/*@Doc:
  This class implements the "statistic tiling" algorithm.

  Three parameters are passed in the constructor of the class,
  the border threshold for considering two access patterns to be the
  same, the interesting threshold which specifies the percentage of
  accesses that must take place so that an areas is considered of interest
  when performing tiling and also the tilesize.

  A call to \c update_stat_information should be made prior to performing
  tiling so that the static information about the accesses to the object
  can be updated and the tiling operation prepared.
