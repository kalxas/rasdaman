 * @brief The HealthServiceImpl class
 * Health checks are used to probe whether the server is able to handle rpcs.
 * A server may choose to reply “unhealthy” because it is not ready to take requests or for some other reason.
 * The client can act accordingly if the response is not received within some time window or the response says unhealthy in it.
 * A client can query the server’s health status by calling the Check method, and a deadline should be set on the rpc.
 * The client can optionally set the service name it wants to query for health status.
 * The suggested format of service name is package_names.ServiceName
