/*@Doc:
This class stores data of hierarchical indexes in the database.  It is extended
to store tiles _inline_.  this means it
is possible for this class to concatenate several tiles into one large blob and
store this blob in the database.  the
tiles must be inlinetiles.  it is only interessting if the size of the tiles is
very small (smaller than a disc page).

for further information on the methods of this class see hierindexds and indexds
interface classes in indexmgr.
