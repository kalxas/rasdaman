# parameter:     metadata_in_covsummary
# purpose:       OWS metadata in the coverage summaries of the capabilities document can be disabled here (true/false).
# description:   This kind of metadata can be added either manually in ps_extra_metadata table or through rasimport `--metadata' argument.
#                Due to the fast growth in the capabilities document if each coverage includes an ows:Metadata element, here you
#                can tell Petascope to ignore such elements.
# need to adapt: yes

# purpose:       true/false switch for enabling/disabling the insertion of wcs:BoundingBox elements in every wcs:CoverageSummary (capabilities document).
# description:   The WCS capabilities document can be used at different levels, depending on the specific service.
#                This parameter (along with other *_in_covsummary parameters) let you fine-tune the amount of information
#                that Petascope should put inside of every wcs:CoverageSummary element. The more the number of coverages offered by
#                A service, the more painful can the response time get damaged by having this param set to true (an RasQL sdom request is called).
# need to adapt: yes

# description:   As for other *_in_covsummary parameters, this one lets you fine-tune the coverage summaries in the capabilities document.
#                Though they can be useful for having a richer catalog of coverages directly from WCS, you can always turn off
#                the insertion of already inserted descriptions (petascopedb::ps_descriptions) by setting this to false.
# need to adapt: yes
description_in_covsummary=false

# parameter:     petascope_servlet_url
# purpose:       service endpoint can be set here.
# description:   This property is used by WCS GetCapabilities() response <ows:HTTP> element to give the service endpoint.
#                Leave it null in case you want Petascope to declare the service URL based on the first request it receives after deploy.
#                Set this parameter to your public service URL in case you are using a proxy.
# need to adapt: no

# parameter:     jetty_extracted_path
# purpose:       Change path of extracted_jetty when user start_rasdaman

# parameter:     java_server
# purpose:       Allowing user to start Petascope with embedded (Jetty) or external (Tomcat)
#                (use ./configure --with-java-server=embedded/external).
# description:   User could set to external (Tomcat - Petascope) or embedded (Jetty - Petascope).
#                When setting to "embedded", user could start embedded Petascope after starting Rasdaman in script start_rasdaman.sh.
# need to adapt: yes (depend on user environment), normally is external.

# parameter:     start_emdedded_petascope
# purpose:       Allowing user to start embedded Jetty - Petascope after excute start_rasdaman.sh.
# description:   User could enable or disable Jetty - Petascope with: permanent by configuration:"true/false" or temporary enable/disable
#                when running script start_rasdaman.sh
