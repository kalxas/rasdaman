# SYNOPSIS
#    migrate_petascopedb.sh
# Description
#    This script is used to migrate coverages imported by wcst_import, OWS Service 
#    metadata and WMS 1.3 layers. For more details see
#    http://rasdaman.org/wiki/PetascopeUserGuide#Databasemigration
#
#    There are 2 types of migration:
#     1. Migrate petascopedb 9.4 or older. After the migration, the old 
#        petascopedb is backed up at petascope_94_backup.    
#     2. Migrate petascopedb 9.5 or newer to a different database name or 
#        different database (e.g. PostgreSQL to HSQLDB).
#
# Preconditions
#    - The petascope web application must not be running (e.g: in Tomcat) while 
#      migrating to a different database (type 2 above) to protect the existing 
#      data integrity.
