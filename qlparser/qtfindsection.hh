    let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a codimension $k$ affince subspace.

    the goal of this class is to compute $s: \mathbb{R}^{n-k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$
    where $s$ is the unique function such that $\pi: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$
    commutes with $s$ with $Im(s) = S$.

    We require data defining $S$ to be of the form $Ax = b$ iff $x \in S$, where
    $A \in \mathrm{Mat}_{k, n}(\mathbb{R})$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^k$. This is passed as
    a pair, linEqnArg, to the constructor.

    We also require data defining which dimensions are kept or which are projected away.
    By convenction, our constructor assumes that it receives the kept dimensions. It is passed
    as a vector of r_Dimension called keptDimsArg.
