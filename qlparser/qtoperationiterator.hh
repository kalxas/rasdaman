/*@Doc:

A QtOperationIterator takes the next element of its input streams an creates
a tuple out of them. The operation specified through an operation tree of type
QtOperation is evaluated for this tuple and the result is passed to its output
stream. The class stands for the SELECT part of a query. The operations in the
SELECT clause are expressed through an operation tree which is attached to this
class.
