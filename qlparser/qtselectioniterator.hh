/*@Doc:

A condition expression specified through a reference to
an instance of the QtOperation sub-hierarchy, is evaluated for the actual input
The boolean result determines if the tuple is passed to the output stream or not.
So the method <tt>next()</tt> reads tuples from its inputs until one can be
passed to its caller. The class represents the WHERE condition in the query
