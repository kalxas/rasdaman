Introduction
############


The goodies of database technology for building flexible, large-scale
information systems are well known:

* **information integration** bringing along better consistency and much
  easier administration
* **flexibility** by replacing static APIs by dynamic query languages
* **scalability** achieved through advanced storage and processing techniques,
  in particular: query optimization which is a powerful performance booster
* **maturity** of decades of development and functionality richness, as
  opposed to 1.0 versions of reinvented wheels (load balancing, indexing,
  transaction handling, catalog metadata management, ...)

Unfortunately, these advantages until now can be reaped only for alphanumeric
(and, more recently, also vectorial) data types. Raster data (also called
gridded data, sampled data, etc.) do not benefit, since traditional databases do
not support the information category of large, multidimensional arrays.

This gap is closed by the rasdaman technology which offers distinct array
management features. Its conceptual model supports arrays of any number of
dimensions and over virtually any cell ("pixel", "voxel") type. The rasdaman
query language, rasql, is crafted along standard SQL and gives high-level,
declarative access to any kind of raster data. Its architecture principle of
**tile stream processing**, together with highly effective optimizations, has
proven scalable into multi-Terabyte object sizes. Rasdaman has been developed
since 1996 and since has reached a high level of maturity itself being in
operational use since many years.

The rasdaman project strongly commits itself to open standards, in
particular those of the geo service community. We actively participate in the
development and maintenance of the `Open Geospatial Consortium
<http://www.opengeospatial.org>`__ open geo raster standards. Among other
activities, we have developed specification and reference implementation of OGC
WCS 2.0, WCPS, and WPS.

The free and open-source **rasdaman community** version is available for free
download; generally, rasdaman is available in a dual [wiki:License license
model]. If the **scientific background** of rasdaman is of interest, then check out our
`Publications <http://www.faculty.jacobs-university.de/pbaumann/iu-bremen.de_pbaumann/pubs.html>`__
...and cite our papers!

Features
========

**Technically**, rasdaman is a `domain independent Array DBMS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS>`__, which makes it suitable for `all
applications where raster data management is an issue
<http://rasdaman.org/wiki/ApplicationDomains>`_. The `petascope
<http://rasdaman.org/wiki/Documentation>`_ component of rasdaman adds on geo
semantics for example, with full support for the `OGC
<http://www.opengeospatial.org>`__ standard interfaces `WCS
<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs>`__, `WCPS
<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps>`__, WCS-T, and WMS; see matrix
below for details and `EarthLook <http://www.earthlook.org>`__ for a
kaleidoscope of hands-on interactive demos.

**Historically**, rasdaman has pioneered the field of Array Databases, being the
first system of this kind. The rasdaman technology has been developed over a
series of EU funded projects and then marketed by `rasdaman GmbH
<http://www.rasdaman.com>`__, a research spin-off dedicated to its commercial
support, since 2003. In 2008/2009, the company has teamed up with `Jacobs
University <http://www.jacobs-university.de/lsis>`__ for a code split to
establish *rasdaman community* (encompassing a complete Array DBMS) as an
open-source project. The original rasdaman code remains as *rasdaman
enterprise*. Both are kept in sync at any time, and both `rasdaman GmbH
<http://www.rasdaman.com>`__ and `Jacobs University
<http://www.jacobs-university.de/lsis>`__ contribute actively to the open-source
project. The features covered here concern the open-source community version;
a summary of *rasdaman community* versus *rasdaman enterprise* was
presented here earlier, but has been meanwhile abandoned as OSGeo frowned on this.

**Contributions** to the rasdaman community code come from a worldwide team of
collaborators. Notably, a significant extent of the fixes and new functionality
is coming from rasdaman GmbH (such as WMS recently). **All community
contributions submitted are made available in rasdaman community immediately
after checking them for correctness and coherence (eg, with the code guide); no
contribution whatsoever goes into rasdaman enterprise first**. The only action
the company undertakes is to keep both rasdaman variants in sync by merging the
rasdaman community tree into rasdaman enterprise, which typically occurs upon
release of versions so as to keep both in sync. Aside from that, rasdaman
enterprise is developed exclusively by the company and does not contain any
community code that rasdaman community does not contain. So rest assured that
your valuable contributions are to the benefit of the worldwide user community.

Array data model
----------------

Arrays are determined by their extent ("domain") and their cell
("pixel", "voxel"). Extents are given by a lower and upper bound taken
from the integer domain (so negative boundaries are possible as long as
the lower bound remains below the upper bound). For the cells, all base
and composite data types allowed in languages like C/C++ (except for
pointers and arrays) can be defined as cell types, including nested
structs.

Over such typed arrays, collections (ie, tables -
`ODMG <http://www.odmg.org>`__ style, again) are built. Collections have
two columns (attributes), a system-maintained object identifier (OID)
and the array itself. This allows to conveniently embed arrays into
relational modeling: foreign keys in conventional tables allow to
reference particular array objects, in connection with a domain
specification even parts of arrays.

As such, rasdaman is prepared for the forthcoming ISO SQL/MDA
("Multi-Dimensional Arrays") standard, which actually is crafted along
rasdaman array model and query language. This standard will define arrays
as new attribute types, following an "array-as-an-attribute" approach
for optimal integration with relations (as opposed to an
"attribute-as-table" approach - as pursued, e.g., by SciDB and SciQL -
which has some remarkable shortcomings in practice).

Query language
--------------

The rasdaman query language, rasql, offers raster processing formulated
through expressions over raster operations in the style of
`SQL <http://www.sql.org>`__. Consider the following query: "*The
difference of red and green channel from all images from collection
LandsatImages where somewhere in the red channel intensity exceeds
127*". In rasql, it is expressed as

.. code-block:: rasql

    select ls.red - ls.green
    from LandsatImages as ls
    where max_cells( ls.red ) > 127

Rasql is a full query language, supporting *select*, *insert*, *update*,
and *delete*. Additionally, the concept of a partial update is
introduced which allows to selectively update parts of an array. In view
of the potentially large size of arrays this is a practically very
relevant feature, e.g., for updating satellite image maps with new
incoming imagery.

Query formulation is done in a declarative style (queries express what
the result should look like, not how to compute it). This allows for
extensive optimization on server side. Further, rasql is safe in
evaluation: every valid query is guaranteed to terminate in finite
time.

C++ and Java API
----------------

Client development is supported by the C++ API, *raslib*, and the Java
API, *rasj*; both adhere to the `ODMG standard <http://www.odmg.org>`__.
Communication with a rasdaman database is simple: open a connection,
send the query string, receive the result set. Iterators allow
convenient acecss to query results.

Once installed, go into the share/rasdaman/examples subdirectory to find
sample code.

Tiled storage
-------------

On server side, arrays are stored inside a standard database. To this
end, arrays are partitioned into subarrays called *tiles*; each such
tile goes into a BLOB (binary large object) in a relational table. This
allows conventional relational database systems to maintain arrays of
unlimited size.

A spatial index allows to quickly locate the tiles required for
determining the tile set addressed by a query.

The partitioning scheme is open - any kind of tiling can be specified
during array instantiation. A set of tiling strategies is provided to
ease administrators in picking the most efficient tiling.

Tile streaming
--------------

Query evaluation in the server follows the principle of *tile
streaming*. Each operator node processes a set of incoming tiles and
generates an output tile stream itself. In many cases this allows to
keep only one database tile at a time in main memory. Query processing
becomes very efficient even on low-end server machines.

Server multiplexing
-------------------

A rasdaman server installation can consist of an arbitrary number of
rasdaman server processes. A dynamic scheduler, *rasmgr*, receives
incoming connection requests and assigns a free server process. This
server process then is dedicated to the particular client until the
connection is closed. This allows for highly concurrent access and, at
the same time, increases overall safety as clients are isolated against
each other.

Rasdaman Application Domains
============================

Its features make rasdaman suitable for all applications where raster data
management is an issue, such as:

**earth sciences**

    1-D sensor time series; 2-D airborne/satellite image maps; 3-D satellite image time series; 3-D geo tomograms; 4-D climate and ocean data; ...
    At `EarthLook <http://www.earthlook.org>`_ there is a demonstration of services on 1-D to 4-D geo raster objects.
    The workhorse of the service stack is rasdaman, running on top of `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org>`_.

**space sciences**

    2-D visibility maps; x/y/frequency observation data cubes; 4-D cosmological simulation data; ...

**life sciences**

    3-D brain activation maps; 3-D/4-D gene expression maps; ...

**engineering**

    1-D measurement time series; 3-D/4-D simulation result data; ...

**multimedia**

    1-D audio; 2-D imagery; 3-D movies; ...

See the `publication list <http://www.peter-baumann.org/pubs.html>`_
for descriptions of a variety of projects where rasdaman has been
successfully used.


OGC geo standards support
=========================

While rasdaman itself is domain agnostic and supports any array
application, the *petascope* servlet, as part of rasdaman, adds in geo
semantics, such as dealing with geo coordinates. To this end, rasdaman
implements the `Open Geospatial
Consortium <http://www.opengeospatial.org>`__ standards for gridded
`coverages <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_data>`__, i.e.,
multi-dimensional raster data. The OGC service interfaces supported are
- `Web Coverage Service <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Service>`__: a versatile, modular suite for accessing and server-side processing of coverages,
- `Web Coverage Processing Service <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Processing_Service>`__: OGC's Big Datacube Analytics language,
- `Web Map Service <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service>`__: for rendering coverage data into maps which can be displayed with a wide range of open-source and commercial clients.

The Princial Architect of rasdaman, Peter Baumann, is `chair of the OGC
WCS Standards Working Group (WCS.SWG) and editor of coverage model
(GMLCOV), WCPS, and most of the WCS
specifications <http://www.ogcnetwork.net/wcs>`__, rasdaman naturally
has become Reference Implementation for several of these standards and
usually implements them first and way ahead of other systems, even
before final adoption. Likewise, any changes to coverage-related
specifications usually are verified in rasdaman first and, hence, become
available early. The same holds for the OGC conformance testing of
coverage services where rasdaman code contributors have a lead. In
summary, rasdaman can be considered the most comprehensive and best
tested implementation of the OGC coverage standards.

.. _reporting-problems:

Reporting problems
==================

Reporting problems should be done by sending an email to the `rasdaman-users 
mailing list <https://rasdaman.org/wiki/MailingLists>`__. Your email should
include a report with *relevant information* about the issue, either prepared 
with help of the :ref:`prepare_issue_report.sh script 
<executables-prepare-issue-report>`, or manually specified as bellow:

1. OS distribution and version (see /etc/os-release)

2. Rasdaman version

 - Ubuntu: ``apt-cache show rasdaman``

 - CentOS: ``yum info rasdaman``

3. Concise description of your activity that led to the problematic behavior: queries, package management commands, etc.

4. Properties of the data operated on, including (but not limited to) data
   format, pixel type, coordinate reference system, dimension, along with data
   ingestion details (ingredients files, scripts); include a small resized data
   sample if possible, output of WCS DescribeCoverage of affected coverages,
   dbinfo on the underlying collections and spatial domain:

   .. code-block:: shell

     coverageId=???
     ows_endpoint="http://localhost:8080/rasdaman/ows"
     describe_cov_req="service=WCS&version=2.0.1&request=DescribeCoverage&coverageId=${coverageId}"

     curl "${ows_endpoint}?${describe_cov_req}" > DescribeCoverage.xml
     rasql -q "select dbinfo(c) from $coverageId as c" --out string > dbinfo.json
     rasql -q "select sdom(c) from $coverageId as c" --out string > sdom.txt
     tar cfz /tmp/data_details.tar.gz DescribeCoverage.xml dbinfo.json sdom.txt

   Attach ``/tmp/data_details.tar.gz`` to the report, along with the ingredient files.
   Sample data should be uploaded elsewhere, e.g. Google Drive, if it is larger than
   20 MB.

5. Relevant log files in ``/opt/rasdaman/log`` and ``/var/log/tomcat*/``; you
   can compress the last 20 log files as follows (but try to execute the
   problematic query / operation last, just before the step below):

   .. code-block:: shell

     cd /opt/rasdaman/log
     petascope_log="$(sudo find /var/log/ -name petascope.log)"
     tar cfz /tmp/rasdaman_logs.tar.gz $(ls -t | head -n 20) $petascope_log
                                       
   Attach ``/tmp/rasdaman_logs.tar.gz`` to the report.

   Prior to sending your request, you should inspect the log files, they may
   already provide a clue that helps you resolve the issue.


.. _executables-prepare-issue-report:

Script for issue reporting
--------------------------

Rasdaman distributes with a ``prepare_issue_report.sh`` script in
``/opt/rasdaman/bin``, which helps prepare a report for an issue encountered
while operating rasdaman. Running the script will open an editor where you can
enter a description of how the issue got triggered.

Various options can be specified to control what additional information is
included in order to help developers in understanding and reproducing the
issue. Following the options, you can specify files to include in the report,
e.g. screenshots, ingredient files for importing data, sample (downsized if
possible) data, etc.

Everything is compressed into a single archive in the current working
directory from which the script is executed, and the path to it is printed at
the end.

By default the script will try to include config files, latest 200 log files,
petascopedb, and RASBASE, as long as the resulting archive is not larger than
20 MB to make it suitable for sending by email. Parts which are too large
will be left out, in reverse order of priority (first RASBASE, then
petascopedb, etc). The limit can be changed with --limit-size <N>. As soon as
a particular --include-* option is specified, the default behavior is no
longer in effect and exclusively the specified options are considered.

Check ``prepare_issue_report.sh --help`` for a list of all available
options.

**Examples**

1. Describe the issue, including config files and 100 most recent log files,
   as well as a screenshot illustrating the problem: ::

     $ prepare_issue_report.sh --include-recent-logs 100 -f screenshot.png \
                               --no-coverage-id

2. Describe the issue, include config files, all log files, petascopedb and
   RASBASE, as well as sample data and ingredients: ::

     $ prepare_issue_report.sh --include-all-logs --include-petascopedb \
                               --include-rasbase -f sample_data.tar.gz \
                               -f ingredients.json --no-coverage-id

3. Like the first example, but also include information about coverage TestCov: ::

     $ prepare_issue_report.sh --include-recent-logs 100 --coverage-id TestCov \
                               -f screenshot.png

4. Provide a screenshot and include details up to a maximum archive size of
   20 MB (default behavior): ::

     $ prepare_issue_report.sh -f screenshot.png --no-coverage-id
