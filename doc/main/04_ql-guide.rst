Overview
========

This guide provides information about how to use the rasdaman database
management system (in short: rasdaman). The document explains usage of the
rasdaman Query Language.

Follow the instructions in this guide as you develop your application which
makes use of rasdaman services. Explanations detail how to create type
definitions and instances; how to retrieve information from databases; how to
insert, manipulate, and delete data within databases.

Audience
========

The information in this manual is intended primarily for application developers;
additionally, it can be useful for advanced users of rasdaman applications and
for database administrators.

Rasdaman Documentation Set
==========================

This manual should be read in conjunction with the complete rasdaman
documentation set which this guide is part of. The documentation set in
its completeness covers all important information needed to work with
the rasdaman system, such as programming and query access to databases,
guidance to utilities such as raswct, release notes, and additional
information on the rasdaman wiki.


.. _introduction:

Introduction
************

Multidimensional Data
=====================

In principle, any natural phenomenon becomes spatio-temporal array data
of some specific dimensionality once it is sampled and quantised for
storage and manipulation in a computer system; additionally, a variety
of artificial sources such as simulators, image renderers, and data
warehouse population tools generate array data. The common
characteristic they all share is that a large set of large
multidimensional arrays has to be maintained. We call such arrays
multidimensional discrete data (or short: MDD) expressing the
variety of dimensions and separating them from the conceptually
different multidimensional vectorial data appearing in geo databases.

rasdaman is a domain-independent database management system (DBMS) which
supports multidimensional arrays of any size and dimension and over
freely definable cell types. Versatile interfaces allow rapid
application deployment while a set of cutting-edge intelligent
optimization techniques in the rasdaman server ensures fast, efficient
access to large data sets, particularly in networked environments.

Rasdaman Overall Architecture
=============================

The rasdaman client/server DBMS has been designed using internationally
approved standards wherever possible. The system follows a two-tier
client/server architecture with query processing completely done in the
server. Internally and invisible to the application, arrays are
decomposed into smaller units which are maintained in a conventional
DBMS, for our purposes called the *base DBMS*.

On the other hand, the base DBMS usually will hold alphanumeric data
(such as metadata) besides the array data. Rasdaman offers means to
establish references between arrays and alphanumeric data in both
directions.

Hence, all multidimensional data go into the same physical database as
the alphanumeric data, thereby considerably easing database maintenance
(consistency, backup, etc.).

   Embedding of rasdaman in IT infrastructure


Further information on application program interfacing, administration,
and related topics is available in the other components of the rasdaman
documentation set.

Interfaces
==========

The syntactical elements explained in this document comprise the rasql
language interface to rasdaman. There are several ways to actually enter
such statements into the rasdaman system:

-  By using the rasql command-line tool to send queries to rasdaman and
   get back the results.

-  By developing an application program which uses the raslib/rasj function
   ``oql_execute()`` to forward query strings to the rasdaman server and get
   back the results.

Developing applications using the client API is the subject of this document.
Please refer to the :ref:`cpp-dev-guide` or :ref:`java-dev-guide` of the
rasdaman documentation set for further information.

rasql and Standard SQL
======================

The declarative interface to the rasdaman system consists of the
*rasdaman Query Language,* rasql, which supports retrieval,
manipulation, and data definition.

Moreover, the rasdaman query language, rasql, is very similar - and in fact
embeds into - standard SQL. With only slight adaptations, rasql has been
standardized by ISO as 9075 SQL Part 15: MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays). Hence,
if you are familiar with SQL, you will quickly be able to use rasql. Otherwise
you may want to consult the introductory literature referenced at the end of
this chapter.


Notational Conventions
======================

The following notational conventions are used in this manual:

Program text (under this we also subsume queries in the document on
hand) is printed in a ``monotype font``. Such text is further
differentiated into keywords and syntactic variables. Keywords like
struct are printed in boldface; they have to be typed in as is.

An optional clause is enclosed in brackets; an arbitrary
repetition is indicated through brackets and an ellipsis. Grammar alternatives
can be grouped in parentheses separated by a ``|`` symbol.

**Example**

.. parsed-literal::

    select :token:`resultList`
    from :token:`namedCollection` [ [ as ] :token:`collIterator` ]
         [ , :token:`namedCollection` [ [ as ] :token:`collIterator` ] ]...
    [ where :token:`booleanExp` ]

It is important not to mix the regular brackets ``[`` and ``]`` denoting
array access, trimming, etc., with the grammar brackets ``[`` and ``]``
denoting optional clauses and repetition; in grammar excerpts the first case
is in double quotes. The same applies to parentheses.

Italics are used in the text to draw attention to the first
instance of a defined term in the text. In this case, the font is the
same as in the running text, not Courier as in code pieces.


.. _terminology:

***********
Terminology
***********

An Intuitive Definition
=======================

An array is a set of elements which are ordered in space. The space
considered here is discretized, i.e., only integer coordinates are
admitted. The number of integers needed to identify a particular
position in this space is called the *dimension* (sometimes also
referred to as *dimensionality*). Each array element, which is referred
to as *cell*, is positioned in space through its *coordinates*.

A cell can contain a single value (such as an intensity value in case of
grayscale images) or a composite value (such as integer triples for the
red, green, and blue component of a color image). All cells share the
same structure which is referred to as the *array cell type* or *array
base type*.

Implicitly a neighborhood is defined among cells through their
coordinates: incrementing or decrementing any component of a coordinate
will lead to another point in space. However, not all points of this
(infinite) space will actually house a cell. For each dimension, there
is a *lower* and *upper bound*, and only within these limits array cells
are allowed; we call this area the *spatial domain* of an array. In the
end, arrays look like multidimensional rectangles with limits parallel
to the coordinate axes. The database developer defines both spatial
domain and cell type in the *array type definition*. Not all bounds have
to be fixed during type definition time, though: It is possible to leave
bounds open so that the array can dynamically grow and shrink over its
lifetime.

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figure2.png
   :align: center

   Constituents of an array


Synonyms for the term array are *multidimensional array* / *MDA*,
*multi­dimen­sional data* / *MDD*, *raster data*, *gridded data*. They are used
interchangeably in the rasdaman documentation.

In rasdaman databases, arrays are grouped into collections. All elements
of a collection share the same array type definition (for the remaining
degrees of freedom see :ref:`sec-array-types`). Collections form the basis for
array handling, just as tables do in relational database technology.

A Technical Definition
======================

Programmers who are familiar with the concept of arrays in programming
languages maybe prefer this more technical definition:

An array is a mapping from integer coordinates, the spatial domain, to
some data type, the cell type. An array's spatial domain, which is
always finite, is described by a pair of lower bounds and upper bounds
for each dimension, resp. Arrays, therefore, always cover a finite,
axis-parallel subset of Euclidean space.

Cell types can be any of the base types and composite types defined in
the ODMG standard and known, for example from C/C++. In fact, most
admissible C/C++ types are admissible in the rasdaman type system, too.

In rasdaman, arrays are strictly typed wrt. spatial domain and cell
type. Type checking is done at query evaluation time. Type checking can
be disabled selectively for an arbitrary number of lower and upper
bounds of an array, thereby allowing for arrays whose spatial domains
vary over the array lifetime.


***************
Sample Database
***************


Collection mr
=============

This section introduces sample collections used later in this manual.
The sample database which is shipped together with the system contains
the schema and the instances outlined in the sequel.

Collection ``mr`` consists of three images (see :numref:`figure3`\ ) taken from the
same patient using magnetic resonance tomography. Images are 8 bit
grayscale with pixel values between 0 and 255 and a size of 256x211.

.. _figure3:

   :align: center

   Sample collection ``mr``


Collection mr2
==============

Collection ``mr2`` consists of only one image, namely the first image of
collection ``mr`` (:numref:`fig-mr2`). Hence, it is also 8 bit grayscale with
size 256x211.

.. _fig-mr2:

   :width: 211px

   Sample collection ``mr2``


Collection rgb
==============

The last example collection, ``rgb``, contains one item, a picture of the
anthur flower  (:numref:`fig-rgb`). It is an RGB image of size 400x344 where
each pixel is composed of three 8 bit integer components for the red, green, and
blue component, resp.

.. _sec-rasql-typedef:

***************************
Type Definition Using rasql
***************************

Overview
========

Every instance within a database is described by its *data type* (i.e.,
there is exactly one data type to which an instance belongs; conversely,
one data type can serve to describe an arbitrary number of instances).
Each database contains a self-contained set of such type definitions; no
other type information, external to a database, is needed for database
access.

Types in rasdaman establish a 3-level hierarchy:

-  *Cell types* can be atomic base types (such as char or float) or
   composite ("struct") types such as red / green / blue color pixels.

-  *Array types* define arrays over some atomic or struct cell type and
   a spatial domain.

-  *Set types* describe sets of arrays of some particular array type.

Types are identified by their name which must be unique within a database and
not exceed length of 200 characters. Like any other identifier in rasql queries,
type names are case-sensitive, consist of only letters, digits, or underscore,
and must start with a letter.


.. _sec-cell-types:

Cell types
==========

Atomic types
------------

The set of standard atomic types, which is generated during creation of a
database, materializes the base types defined in the ODMG standard
(cf. :numref:`table-atomic-types`).

.. _table-atomic-types:

.. table:: rasdaman atomic cell types

    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | **type name**      | **size**   | **description**                          |
    +====================+============+==========================================+
    | ``bool``           | 1 bit [2]_ | true (nonzero value), false (zero value) |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``octet``          | 8 bit      | signed integer                           |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``char``           | 8 bit      | unsigned integer                         |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``short``          | 16 bit     | signed integer                           |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``unsigned short`` | 16 bit     | unsigned integer                         |
    | / ``ushort``       |            |                                          |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``long``           | 32 bit     | signed integer                           |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``unsigned long``  | 32 bit     | unsigned integer                         |
    | / ``ulong``        |            |                                          |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``float``          | 32 bit     | single precision floating point          |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``double``         | 64 bit     | double precision floating point          |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``CInt16``         | 32 bit     | complex of 16 bit signed integers        |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``CInt32``         | 64 bit     | complex of 32 bit signed integers        |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``CFloat32``       | 64 bit     | single precision floating point complex  |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+
    | ``CFloat64``       | 128 bit    | double precision floating point complex  |
    +--------------------+------------+------------------------------------------+


Composite types
---------------

More complex, composite cell types can be defined arbitrarily, based on the
system-defined atomic types. The syntax is as follows: ::

    create type typeName
    as (
      attrName_1 atomicType_1,
      ...
      attrName_n atomicType_n
    )

Attribute names must be unique within a composite type, otherwise an
exception is thrown. No other type with the name ``typeName`` may pre-exist
already.

Example
-------

An RGB pixel type can be defined as ::

    create type RGBPixel
    as (
      red char,
      green char,
      blue char
    )

.. _sec-array-types:

Array types
===========

An **marray** ("multidimensional array") type defines an array type
through its cell type (see :ref:`sec-cell-types`) and a spatial domain.

Syntax
------

The syntax for creating an marray type is as below. There are two
variants, corresponding to the dimensionality specification alternatives
described above: ::

    create type typeName
    as baseTypeName mdarray domainSpec


where ``baseTypeName`` is the name of a defined cell type (atomic or composite)
and ``domainSpec`` is a multidimensional interval specification as described
in the following section.

Alternatively, a composite cell type can be indicated in-place: ::

    create type typeName
    as (
      attrName_1 atomicType_1,
      ...
      attrName_n atomicType_n
    ) mdarray domainSpec


No type (of any kind) with name ``typeName`` may pre-exist already,
otherwise an exception is thrown.

Attribute names must be unique within a composite type, otherwise an
exception is thrown.

Spatial domain
--------------

Dimensions and their extents are specified by providing an axis name for
each dimension and, optionally, a lower and upper bound: ::

    [ a_1 ( lo_1 : hi_1 ), ... , a_d ( lo_d : hi_d ) ]

    [ a_1 , ... , a_d ]

where ``d`` is a positive integer number, ``a_i`` are identifiers, and ``lo_1``
and ``hi_1`` are integers such that ``lo_1`` :math:`\le` ``hi_1``. Both ``lo_1``
and ``hi_1`` can be an asterisk (``*``) instead of a number, in which case no
limit in the particular direction of the axis will be enforced. If the bounds
``lo_1`` and ``hi_1`` on a particular axis are not specified, they are assumed
to be equivalent to ``*``.

Axis names must be unique within a domain specification, otherwise an
exception is thrown.

Currently axis names are ignored and cannot be used in queries yet.

Examples
--------

The following statement defines a 2-D RGB image, based on the definition of
``RGBPixel`` as shown above: ::

    create type RGBImage
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x ( 0:1023 ), y ( 0:767 ) ]

An 2-D image without any extent limitation can be defined through: ::

    create type UnboundedImage
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x, y ]

which is equivalent to ::

    create type UnboundedImage
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x ( *:* ), y ( *:* ) ]

Selectively we can also limit only the bounds on the x axis for example: ::

    create type PartiallyBoundedImage
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x ( 0 : 1023 ), y ]


.. _sec-set-types:

Set types
=========

A **set** type defines a collection of arrays sharing the same marray type.
Additionally, a collection can also have null values which are used in order to
characterise sparse arrays. A sparse array is an array where some of the
elements have a null value.

Syntax
------

::

    create type typeName
    as set ( marrayTypeName [ nullValues ] )


where ``marrayTypeName`` is the name of a defined marray type and
``null­Values`` is an optional specification of a set of values to be treated as
nulls; for semantics in operations refer to :ref:`sec-nullvalues`.

No type with the name *typeName* may pre-exist already.

Null Values
-----------

The optional ``nullValues`` clause in a set type definition is a set of null
value intervals: ::

    null values [ nullInterval, ... ]

Each ``nullInterval`` can be a pair of lower and upper limits (1, 2, 3), or a
single (double) value (1): ::

    lo : hi     (1)
     * : hi     (2)
    lo : *      (3)

    nullValue   (4)


In case of an interval, the three variants are interpreted as follows:

1. Both ``lo`` and ``hi`` are double values such that ``lo`` :math:`\le` ``hi``;

2. ``lo`` is ``*`` and ``hi`` is a double value, indicating that all values
   lower than ``hi`` are null values;

3. ``lo`` is a double value and ``hi`` is ``*``, indicating that all values
   greater than ``lo`` are null values.

For floating-point data it is recommended to always specify small intervals
instead of single numbers with variant (4).

Limitation
^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, only atomic null values can be indicated. They apply to all
components of a composite cell simultaneously. In future it may become possible
to indicate null values individually per struct component.


Examples
--------

The following statement defines a set type of 2-D RGB images, based on the
definition of ``RGBImage``: ::

    create type RGBSet
    as set ( RGBImage )

If values 0, 253, 254, and 255 are to be considered null values, this
can be specified as follows: ::

    create type RGBSet
    as set ( RGBImage null values [ 0, 253 : 255 ] )

Note that these null values will apply equally to every band.
It is not possible to separate null values per band.

As the cell type in this case is char (possible values between 0 and 255), the
type can be equivalently specified like this: ::

    create type RGBSet
    as set ( RGBImage null values [ 0, 253 : * ] )

With the set type below, values which are nan are null values (nanf is the float
constant, while nan is the double constant): ::

    create type FloatSetNanNullValue
    as set ( FloatImage null values [nanf] )

    create type DoubleSetNanNullValue
    as set ( DoubleImage null values [nan] )


.. _sec-drop-types:

Drop type
=========

A type definition can be dropped (i.e., deleted from the database) if it
is not in use. This is the case if both of the following conditions
hold:

-  The type is not used in any other type definition.

-  There are no array instances existing which are based, directly or
   indirectly, on the type on hand.

Further, atomic base types (such as char) cannot be deleted.

**Drop type syntax**

::

    drop type typeName


.. _sec-list-types:

List available types
====================

A list of all types defined in the database can be obtained in textual
form, adhering to the rasql type definition syntax. This is done by
querying virtual collections (similar to the virtual collection
``RAS_COLLECTIONNAMES``).

Technically, the output of such a query is a list of 1-D ``char`` arrays,
each one containing one type definition.

Syntax
------

::

    select typeColl from typeColl

where *typeColl* is one of

- ``RAS_STRUCT_TYPES`` for struct types

- ``RAS_MARRAY_TYPES`` for array types

- ``RAS_SET_TYPES``    for set types

- ``RAS_TYPES``        for union of all types

.. note::
    Collection aliases can be used, such as: ::

        select t from RAS_STRUCT_TYPES as t

    No operations can be performed on the output array.

Example output
--------------

A struct types result may look like this when printed: ::

    create type RGBPixel
    as ( red char, green char, blue char )

    create type TestPixel
    as ( band1 char, band2 char, band3 char )

    create type GeostatPredictionPixel
    as ( prediction float, variance float )

An marray types result may look like this when printed: ::

    create type GreyImage
    as char mdarray [ x, y ]

    create type RGBCube
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x, y, z ]

    create type XGAImage
    as RGBPixel mdarray [ x ( 0 : 1023 ), y ( 0 : 767 ) ]

A set types result may look like this when printed: ::

    create type GreySet
    as set ( GreyImage )

    create type NullValueTestSet
    as set ( NullValueArrayTest null values [5:7] )

An all types result will print combination of all struct types, marray types, and set types results.


Changing types
==============

The type of an existing collection can be changed to another type through
the ``alter`` statement.

The new collection type must be compatible with the old one, which means:

- same cell type
- same dimensionality
- no domain shrinking

Changes are allowed, for example, in the null values.

**Alter type syntax**

::

    alter collection collName
    set type collType

where

- *collName* is the name of an existing collection
- *collType* is the name of an existing collection type

**Usage notes**

The collection does not need to be empty, i.e. it may contain array
objects.

Currently, only set (i.e., collection) types can be modified.

**Example**

Update the set type of a collection ``Bathymetry`` to a new set type that
specifies null values: ::

    alter collection Bathymetry
    set type BathymetryWithNullValues


**************************
Query Execution with rasql
**************************

The rasdaman toolkit offers essentially a couple of ways to communicate with a
database through queries:

-  By submitting queries via command line using rasql; this tool is
   covered in this section.

-  By writing a C++, Java, or Python application that uses the rasdaman APIs
   (raslib, rasj, or rasdapy3 respectively). See the rasdaman API guides for
   further details.

The rasql tool accepts a query string (which can be parametrised as
explained in the API guides), sends it to the server for evaluation, and
receives the result set. Results can be displayed in alphanumeric mode,
or they can be stored in files.

.. _examples-1:

Examples
========

For the user who is familiar with command line tools in general and the
rasql query language, we give a brief introduction by way of examples.
They outline the basic principles through common tasks.

-  Create a collection ``test`` of type ``GreySet`` (note the explicit setting
   of user ``rasadmin``; rasql's default user ``rasguest`` by default cannot
   write):

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q "create collection test GreySet" \
              --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

- Print the names of all existing collections:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q "select r from RAS_COLLECTIONNAMES as r" \
              --out string

-  Export demo collection ``mr`` into TIFF files rasql_1.tif, rasql_2.tif,
   rasql_3.tif (note the escaped double-quotes as required by shell):

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q "select encode(m, \"tiff\") from mr as m"
              --out file

-  Import TIFF file *myfile* into collection ``mr`` as new image (note the
   different query string delimiters to preserve the ``$`` character!):

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q 'insert into mr values decode($1)' \
              -f myfile --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

-  Put a grey square into every mr image:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q "update mr as m set m[0:10,0:10] \
                  assign marray x in [0:10,0:10] values 127c" \
              --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

-  Verify result of update query by displaying pixel values as hex
   numbers:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rasql -q "select m[0:10,0:10] from mr as m" --out hex

Invocation syntax
=================

Rasql is invoked as a command with the query string as parameter.
Additional parameters guide detailed behavior, such as authentication
and result display.

Any errors or other diagnostic output encountered are printed;
transactions are aborted upon errors.

Usage:

.. code-block:: text

    rasql [--query q|-q q] [options]

Options:

-h, --help          show command line switches
-q, --query q       query string to be sent to the rasdaman server
                    for execution

-f, --file f        file name for upload through $i parameters within
                    queries; each $i needs its own file parameter, in proper
                    sequence [4]_. Requires --mdddomain and --mddtype

--content           display result, if any (see also --out and --type for
                    output formatting)

--out t             use display method  t  for cell values of result MDDs
                    where t is one of

                    - none: do not display result item contents

                    - file: write each result MDD into a separate file

                    - string: print result MDD contents as char string (only for 1D arrays of type char)

                    - hex: print result MDD cells as a sequence of space-separated hex values

                    - formatted: reserved, not yet supported

                    Option --out implies --content; default: none

--outfile of        file name template for storing result images (ignored
                    for scalar results). Use '%d' to indicate auto numbering position,
                    like with printf(1). For well-known file types, a proper suffix is
                    appended to the resulting file name. Implies --out file. (default:

******************************
Overview: General Query Format
******************************


Basic Query Mechanism
=====================

rasql provides declarative query functionality on collections (i.e.,
sets) of MDD stored in a rasdaman database. The query language is based
on the SQL-92 standard and extends the language with high-level
multidimensional operators.

The general query structure is best explained by means of an example.
Consider the following query: ::

    select mr[100:150,40:80] / 2
    from mr
    where some_cells( mr[120:160, 55:75] > 250 )


In the **from** clause, mr is specified as the working collection on
which all evaluation will take place. This name, which serves as an
"iterator variable" over this collection, can be used in other parts of
the query for referencing the particular collection element under
inspection.

Optionally, an alias name can be given to the collection (see syntax
below) - however, in most cases this is not necessary.

In the **where** clause, a condition is phrased. Each collection element
in turn is probed, and upon fulfillment of the condition the item is
added to the query result set. In the example query, part of the image
is tested against a threshold value.

Elements in the query result set, finally, can be "post-processed" in
the **select** clause by applying further operations. In the case on
hand, a spatial extraction is done combined with an intensity reduction
on the extracted image part.

In summary, a rasql query returns a set fulfilling some search condition
just as is the case with conventional SQL and OQL. The difference lies
in the operations which are available in the **select** and **where**
clause: SQL does not support expressions containing multi­dimen­sional
operators, whereas rasql does.

**Syntax**

::

    select resultList
    from collName [ as collIterator ]
    [ , collName [ as collIterator ] ] ...
    [ where booleanExp ]


The complete rasql query syntax can be found in the Appendix.

.. _sec-select-clause-result-prep:

Select Clause: Result Preparation
=================================

Type and format of the query result are specified in the **select** part of the
query. The query result type can be multidimensional, a struct or atomic (i.e.,
scalar), or a spatial domain / interval. The select clause can reference the
collection iteration variable defined in the from clause; each array in the
collection will be assigned to this iteration variable successively.

**Example**

Images from collection mr, with pixel intensity reduced by a factor 2: ::

    select mr / 2
    from mr


.. _sec-from-clause-coll-spec:

From Clause: Collection Specification
=====================================

In the **from** clause, the list of collections to be inspected is
specified, optionally together with a variable name which is associated
to each collection. For query evaluation the cross product between all
participating collections is built which means that every possible
combination of elements from all collections is evaluated. For instance
in case of two collections, each MDD of the first collection is combined
with each MDD of the second collection. Hence, combining a collection
with n elements with a collection containing m elements results in n*m
combinations. This is important for estimating query response time.

**Example**

The following example subtracts each MDD of collection mr2 from each MDD
of collection mr (the binary induced operation used in this example is
explained in :ref:`sec-binary-induction`). ::

    select mr - mr2
    from mr, mr2


Using alias variables a and b bound to collections mr and mr2, resp.,
the same query looks as follows: ::

    select a - b
    from mr as a, mr2 as b

**Cross products**

As in SQL, multiple collections in a from clause such as ::

    from c1, c2, ..., ck

are evaluated to a *cross product*. This means that the select clause is
evaluated for a virtual collection that has n1 \* n2 \* ... \* nk elements
if c1 contains n1 elements, c2 contains n2 elements, and so forth.

Warning: This holds regardless of the select expression - even if you mention
only say c1 in the select clause, the number of result elements will
be the product of *all* collection sizes!

Where Clause: Conditions
========================

In the **where** clause, conditions are specified which members of the
query result set must fulfil. Like in SQL, predicates are built as
boolean expressions using comparison, parenthesis, functions, etc.
Unlike SQL, however, rasql offers mechanisms to express selection
criteria on multidimensional items.

**Example**

We want to restrict the previous result to those images where at least
one difference pixel value is greater than 50 (see :ref:`sec-binary-induction`): ::

    select mr - mr2
    from mr, mr2
    where some_cells( mr - mr2 > 50 )


Comments in Queries
===================

Comments are texts which are not evaluated by the rasdaman server in any
way. However, they are useful - and should be used freely - for
documentation purposes; in particular for stored queries it is important
that its meaning will be clear to later readers.

**Syntax**

::

    -- any text, delimited by end of line

**Example**

::

    select mr -- this comment text is ignored by rasdaman
    from mr   -- for comments spanning several lines,
              -- every line needs a separate '--' starter

.. _sec-constants:

Constants

.. _sec-atomic-constants:

Atomic Constants
================

Atomic constants are written in standard C/C++ style. If necessary
con­stants are augmented with a one or two letter postfix to
un­ambiguously determine its data type (:numref:`table-literal-type-suffix`).

The default for integer constants is ``l``, and for floating-point it is ``d``.
Specifiers are case insensitive.

**Example**

::

    25c
    -1700L
    .4e-5D

.. note::
    Boolean constants true and false are unique, so they do not need a
    type specifier.

.. _table-literal-type-suffix:

.. table:: Data type specifiers

    +--------------+----------------+
    | postfix      | type           |
    +==============+================+
    | o            | octet          |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | c            | char           |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | s            | short          |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | us           | unsigned short |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | l            | long           |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | ul           | unsigned long  |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | f            | float          |
    +--------------+----------------+
    | d            | double         |
    +--------------+----------------+


Additionally, the following special floating-point constants are supported as
well:

.. _table-float-constants:

.. table:: Special floating-point constants corresponding to IEEE 754 NaN and Inf.

    +--------------+-----------+
    | **Constant** | **Type**  |
    +==============+===========+
    | NaN          | double    |
    +--------------+-----------+
    | NaNf         | float     |
    +--------------+-----------+
    | Inf          | double    |
    +--------------+-----------+
    | Inff         | float     |
    +--------------+-----------+


Complex numbers
---------------

Special built-in types are ``CFloat32`` and ``CFloat64`` for single and double
precision complex numbers, resp, as well as ``CInt16`` and ``CInt32`` for
signed integer complex numbers.

**Syntax**

::

    complex( re, im )

where *re* and *im* are integer or floating point expressions. The resulting
constant type is summarized on the table below. Further re/im type combinations
are not supported.

.. _table-complex-constants:

.. table:: Complex constant type depends on the type of the re and im arguments.

    +----------------+-----------------+------------------------------+
    | **type of re** | **type of im**  | **type of complex constant** |
    +================+=================+==============================+
    | short          | short           | CInt16                       |
    +----------------+-----------------+------------------------------+
    | long           | long            | CInt32                       |
    +----------------+-----------------+------------------------------+
    | float          | float           | CFloat32                     |
    +----------------+-----------------+------------------------------+
    | double         | double          | CFloat64                     |
    +----------------+-----------------+------------------------------+


**Example**

::

    complex( .35d, 16.0d )  -- CFloat64
    complex( .35f, 16.0f )  -- CFloat32
    complex( 5s, 16s )      -- CInt16
    complex( 5, 16 )        -- CInt32

**Component access**

The complex parts can be extracted with ``.re`` and ``.im``; more details
can be found in the :ref:`induced-operations` section.

.. _sec-composite-constants:

Composite Constants
===================

Composite constants resemble records ("structs") over atomic con­stants or other
records. Notation is as follows.

**Syntax**

::

    struct { const_0, ..., const_n }

where *const_i* must be of atomic or complex type, i.e. nested structs are not
supported.

**Example**

::

    struct{ 0c, 0c, 0c }  -- black pixel in an RGB image, for example
    struct{ 1l, true }    -- mixed component types

**Component access**

See :ref:`sec-struct-component-sel` for details on how to extract the
constituents from a composite value.


.. _sec-arrayconstant:

Array Constants
===============

Small array constants can be indicated literally. An array constant consists of
the spatial domain specification (see :ref:`sec-spatial-domain`) followed by the
cell values whereby value sequencing is as follow. The array is linearized in
a way that the lowest dimension [5]_ is the "outermost" dimension and
the highest dimension [6]_ is the "innermost" one. Within each
dimension, elements are listed sequentially, starting with the lower
bound and proceeding until the upper bound. List elements for the
innermost dimension are separated by comma ",", all others by semicolon ";".

The exact number of values as specified in the leading spatial domain
expression must be provided. All constants must have the same type; this
will be the result array's base type.

**Syntax**

::

    < mintervalExp
      scalarList_0 ; ... ; scalarList_n ; >

where *scalarList* is defined as a comma separated list of literals:

::

    scalar_0, scalar_1, ... scalar_n ;


**Example**

::

    < [-1:1,-2:2] 0, 1, 2, 3, 4;
                  1, 2, 3, 4, 5;
                  2, 3, 4, 5, 6 >


This constant expression defines the following matrix:

.. image:: media/ql-guide/image12.png
    :align: center
    :width: 120px

.. _sec-oid-constants:

Object identifier (OID) Constants
=================================

OIDs serve to uniquely identify arrays (see :ref:`sec-linking-mdd`). Within a
database, the OID of an array is an integer number. To use an OID
outside the context of a particular database, it must be fully qualified
with the system name where the database resides, the name of the
database containing the array, and the local array OID.

The worldwide unique array identifiers, i.e., OIDs, consist of three
components:

-  A string containing the system where the database resides (system
   name),

-  A string containing the database ("base name"), and

-  A number containing the local object id within the database.

The full OID is enclosed in '``<``' and '``>``' characters, the three name
com­ponents are separated by a vertical bar '``|``'.

System and database names obey the naming rules of the underlying
operating system and base DBMS, i.e., usually they are made up of lower
and upper case characters, underscores, and digits, with digits not as
first character. Any additional white space (space, tab, or newline
characters) inbetween is assumed to be part of the name, so this should
be avoided.

The local OID is an integer number.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: text

    < systemName | baseName | objectID >
    objectID

where *systemName* and *baseName* are string literals and *objectID* is
an *integerExp*.


**Example**

.. code-block:: text

    < acme.com | RASBASE | 42 >
    42

.. _sec-string-constants:

String constants
================

A sequence of characters delimited by double quotes is a string.

**Syntax**

::

    "..."

**Example**

::

    SELECT encode(coll, "png") FROM coll


Collection Names
================

Collections are named containers for sets of MDD objects (see
:ref:`sec-linking-mdd`). A collection name is made up of lower and upper
case characters, underscores, and digits. Depending on the underlying base DBMS,
names may be limited in length, and some systems (rare though) may not
distinguish upper and lower case letters.

Operations available on name constants are string equality "``=``" and
inequality "``!=``".


.. _sec-sdom-ops:

*************************
Spatial Domain Operations
*************************

One-Dimensional Intervals
=========================

One-dimensional (1D) intervals describe non-empty, consecutive sets of
integer numbers, described by integer-valued lower and upper bound,
resp.; negative values are admissible for both bounds. Intervals are
specified by indicating lower and upper bound through integer-valued
expressions according to the following syntax:

The lower and upper bounds of an interval can be extracted using the
functions .lo and .hi.

**Syntax**

::

    integerExp_1 : integerExp_2
    intervalExp.lo
    intervalExp.hi

A one-dimensional interval with *integerExp_1* as lower bound and
*integerExp_2* as upper bound is constructed. The lower bound must be
less or equal to the upper bound. Lower and upper bound extrac­tors
return the integer-valued bounds.

**Examples**

An interval ranging from -17 up to 245 is written as::

    -17 : 245

Conversely, the following expression evaluates to 245; note the
parenthesis to enforce the desired evaluation sequence: ::

    (-17 : 245).hi

.. _sec-mintervals:

Multidimensional Intervals
==========================

Multidimensional intervals (*m-intervals*) describe areas in space, or
better said: point sets. These point sets form rectangular and
axis-parallel "cubes" of some dimension. An m-interval's dimension is
given by the number of 1D intervals it needs to be described; the bounds
of the "cube" are indicated by the lower and upper bound of the
respective 1D interval in each dimension.

From an m-interval, the intervals describing a particular dimension can
be extracted by indexing the m-interval with the number of the desired
dimension using the operator ``[]``.

**Dimension counting in an m-interval expression runs from left to
right, starting with lowest dimension number 0.**

**Syntax**

::

    [ intervalExp_0 , ... , intervalExp_n ]
    [ intervalExp_0 , ... , intervalExp_n ] [integerExp ]

An (n+1)-dimensional m-interval with the specified *intervalExp_i* is
built where the first dimension is described by *intervalExp_0*, etc.,
until the last dimension described by *intervalExp_n*.

**Example**

A 2-dimensional m-interval ranging from -17 to 245 in dimension 1 and
from 42 to 227 in dimension 2 can be denoted as

::

    [ -17 : 245, 42 : 227 ]

The expression below evaluates to [42:227].

::

    [ -17 : 245, 42 : 227 ] [1]

\...whereas here the result is 42:

::

    [ -17 : 245, 42 : 227 ] [1].lo


****************
Array Operations
****************

As we have seen in the last Section, *intervals* and *m-intervals*
describe n-dimensional regions in space.

Next, we are going to place information into the regular grid
estab­lished by the m-intervals so that, at the position of every
integer-valued coordinate, a value can be stored. Each such value
container addressed by an n-dimensional coordinate will be referred to
as a *cell*. The set of all the cells described by a particular
m-interval and with cells over a particular base type, then, forms the
*array*.

As before with intervals, we introduce means to describe arrays through
expressions, i.e., to derive new arrays from existing ones. Such
operations can change an arrays shape and dimension (some­times called
geometric operations), or the cell values (referred to as value-changing
operations), or both. In extreme cases, both array dimension, size, and
base type can change completely, for example in the case of a histogram
computation.

First, we describe the means to query and manipulate an array's spatial
domain (so-called geometric operations), then we introduce the means to
query and manipulate an array's cell values (value-changing operations).

Note that some operations are restricted in the operand domains they
accept, as is common in arithmetics in programming languages; division
by zero is a common example. :ref:`sec-errors` contains information about
possible error conditions, how to deal with them, and how to prevent
them.

.. _sec-spatial-domain:

Spatial Domain
==============

The m-interval covered by an array is called the array's *spatial domain*.
Function sdom() allows to retrieve an array's current spatial
domain. The *current domain* of an array is the minimal axis-parallel
bounding box containing all currently defined cells.

As arrays can have variable bounds according to their type definition
(see :ref:`sec-array-types`), their spatial domain cannot always be determined
from the schema information, but must be recorded individually by the
database system. In case of a fixed-size array, this will coincide with
the schema information, in case of a variable-size array it delivers the
spatial domain to which the array has been set. The operators presented
below and in :ref:`sec-update` allow to change an array's spatial domain.
Notably, a collection defined over variable-size arrays can hold arrays
which, at a given moment in time, may differ in the lower and/or upper
bounds of their variable dimensions.

**Syntax**

::

    sdom( mddExp )

Function sdom() evaluates to the current spatial domain of *mddExp*.

**Examples**

Consider an image a of collection mr. Elements from this collection are
defined as having free bounds, but in practice our collection elements
all have spatial domain [0 : 255, 0 : 210]. Then, the
following equi­valences hold:

::

    sdom(a)       = [0 : 255, 0 : 210]
    sdom(a)[0]    = [0 : 255]
    sdom(a)[0].lo = 0
    sdom(a)[0].hi = 255


Geometric Operations
====================

.. _sec-trimming:

Trimming
--------

Reducing the spatial domain of an array while leaving the cell values
unchanged is called *trimming*. Array dimension remains unchanged.
Attempting to extend or intersect the array's spatial domain will lead to an
error; use the :ref:`extend function <sec-extend>` in this case.


.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figure7.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

   Spatial domain modification through trimming (2-D example)

**Syntax**

::

    mddExp [ mintervalExp ]


**Examples**

The following query returns cutouts from the area [120: 160 , 55 : 75]
of all images in collection ``mr`` (see :numref:`figure8`).

::

    select mr[ 120:160, 55:75 ]
    from mr

.. _figure8:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image13.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

   Trimming result


.. _sec-section:

Section
-------

A *section* allows to extract lower-dimen­sional layers ("slices") from
an array.

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figure9.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

   Single and double section through 3-D array, yielding 2-D and 1-D sections.


A section is accomplished through a trim expression by indicating the
slicing position rather than a selection interval. A section can be made
in any dimension within a trim expression. Each section reduces the
dimension by one.

Like with trimming, a section must be within the spatial domain of the array,
otherwise an error indicating that the subset domain extends outside of the
array spatial domain will be thrown.

**Syntax**

::

    mddExp [ integerExp_0 , ... , integerExp_n ]

This makes sections through *mddExp* at positions *integerExp_i* for
each dimension *i*.

**Example**

The following query produces a 2-D section in the 2\ :sup:`nd` dimension
of a 3-D cube: ::

    select Images3D[ 0:256, 10, 0:256 ]
    from Images3D


.. note::
    If a section is done in *every* dimension of an array, the result is one
    single cell. This special case resembles array element access in
    programming languages, e.g., C/C++. However, in rasql the result still
    is an array, namely one with zero dimensions and exactly one element.

**Example**

The following query delivers a set of 0-D arrays containing single
pixels, namely the ones with coordinate [100,150]: ::

    select mr[ 100, 150 ]
    from mr


.. _sec-wildcard:

Trim Wildcard Operator "*"
--------------------------

An asterisk "*" can be used as a shorthand for an sdom() invocation in a
trim expression; the following phrases all are equivalent:

::

    a [ *:*, *:* ] = a [ sdom(a)[0] , sdom(a)[1] ]
                   = a [ sdom(a)[0].lo : sdom(a)[0].hi ,
                         sdom(a)[1].lo : sdom(a)[1].hi ]


An asterisk "*" can appear at any lower or upper bound position within a
trim expression denoting the current spatial domain boundary. A trim
expression can contain an arbitrary number of such wildcards. Note,
however, that an asterisk cannot be used for specifying a section.

**Example**

The following are valid applications of the asterisk operator: ::

    select mr[ 50:*, *:200 ]
    from mr

    select mr[ *:*, 10:150 ]
    from mr

The next is illegal because it attempts to use an asterisk in a section: ::

    select mr[ *, 100:200 ] -- illegal "*" usage in dimension 0
    from mr


**Note**

It is well possible (and often recommended) to use an array's spatial
domain or part of it for query formulation; this makes the query more
general and, hence, allows to establish query libraries. The following
query cuts away the rightmost pixel line from the images:

::

    select mr[ *:*, *:sdom(mr)[1].hi - 1 ]   -- good, portable
    from mr

In the next example, conversely, trim bounds are written explicitly;
this query's trim expression, therefore, cannot be used with any other
array type.

::

    select mr[ 0:767, 0:1023 ]               -- bad, not portable
    from mr

One might get the idea that the last query evaluates faster. This,
however, is not the case; the server's intelligent query engine makes
the first version execute at just the same speed.

.. _sec-pos-independent-subsetting:

Positionally-independent Subsetting
-----------------------------------

Rasdaman supports positionally-independent subsetting like in WCPS and SQL/MDA,
where for each trim/slice the axis name is indicated as well, e.g. ::

	select mr2[d0(0:100), d1(50)] from mr2

The axis names give a reference to the addressed axes, so the order doesn't matter anymore. This is equivalent: ::

	select mr2[d1(50), d0(0:100)] from mr2

Furthermore, not all axes have to be specified. Any axes which are not specified default to "*:*". For example: ::

	select mr2[d1(50)] from mr2
	=
	select mr2[d0(*:*), d1(50)] from mr2

The two subset formats cannot be mixed, e.g. this is an error: ::

	select mr2[d0(0:100), 50] from mr2

.. _sec-shift:

Shifting a Spatial Domain
-------------------------

Built-in function shift() transposes an array: its spatial domain
remains unchanged in shape, but all cell contents simultaneously are
moved to another location in n-dimensional space. Cell values themselves
remain un­changed.

**Syntax**

::

    shift( mddExp , pointExp )

The function accepts an *mddExp* and a *pointExp* and returns an array
whose spatial domain is shifted by vector *pointExp*.

**Example**

The following expression evaluates to an array with spatial domain
``[3:13, 4:24]``. Containing the same values as the original array a. ::

    shift( a[ 0:10, 0:20 ], [ 3, 4 ] )


.. _sec-extend:

Extending a Spatial Domain
--------------------------

Function extend() enlarges a given MDD with the domain specified. The
domain for extending must, for every boundary element, be at least as
large as the MDD's domain boundary. The new MDD contains 0 values in
the extended part of its domain and the MDD's original cell values within
the MDD's domain.

**Syntax**

::

    extend( mddExp , mintervalExp )

The function accepts an *mddExp* and a *mintervalExp* and returns an
array whose spatial domain is extended to the new domain specified by
*mintervalExp*. The result MDD has the same cell type as the input MDD.

Precondition: ::

    sdom( mddExp ) contained in mintervalExp

**Example**

Assuming that MDD ``a`` has a spatial domain of ``[0:50, 0:25]``, the following
expression evaluates to an array with spatial domain ``[-100:100, -50:50]``,
``a``\ 's values in the subdomain ``[0:50, 0:25]``, and 0 values at the
remaining cell positions. ::

    extend( a, [-100:100, -50:50] )


.. _sec-geo-projection:

Geographic projection
---------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

"A map projection is any method of representing the surface of a sphere
or other three-dimensional body on a plane. Map projections are
necessary for creating maps. All map projections distort the surface in
some fashion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distortions are
acceptable and others are not; therefore different map projections exist in
order to preserve some properties of the sphere-like body at the expense
of other properties." (Wikipedia)

Each coordinate tieing a geographic object, map, or pixel to some position
on earth (or some other celestial object, for that matter) is valid only in
conjunction with the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in which it is
expressed. For 2-D Earth CRSs, a set of CRSs and their identifiers is
normatively defined by the OGP Geomatics Committee, formed in 2005 by
the absorption into OGP of the now-defunct European Petroleum Survey
Group (EPSG). By way of tradition, however, this set of CRS definitions
still is known as "EPSG", and the CRS identifiers as "EPSG codes". For
example, EPSG:4326 references the well-known WGS84 CRS.

The ``project()`` function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assume an MDD object ``M`` and two CRS identifiers ``C1`` and ``C2`` such as
"EPSG:4326". The ``project()`` function establishes an output MDD, with same
dimension as ``M``, whose contents is given by projecting ``M`` from CRS ``C1``
into CRS ``C2``.

The ``project()`` function comes in several variants based on the provided
input arguments ::

    (1) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, crsOut )

    (2) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, crsOut, resampleAlg )

    (3) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, boundsOut, crsOut,
                          widthOut, heightOut )

    (4) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, boundsOut, crsOut,
                          widthOut, heightOut, resampleAlg, errThreshold )

    (5) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, boundsOut, crsOut,
                          xres, yres)

    (6) project( mddExpr, boundsIn, crsIn, boundsOut, crsOut,
                          xres, yres, resampleAlg, errThreshold )

where

- ``mddExpr`` - MDD object to be reprojected.

- ``boundsIn`` - geographic bounding box given as a string of comma-separated
  floating-point values of the format: ``"xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax"``.

- ``crsIn`` - geographic CRS as a string. Internally, the ``project()`` function
  is mapped to GDAL; hence, it accepts the same CRS formats as GDAL:

    -  Well Known Text (as per GDAL)

    -  "EPSG:n"

    -  "EPSGA:n"

    -  "AUTO:proj_id,unit_id,lon0,lat0" indicating OGC WMS auto projections

    -  "``urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::n``" indicating OGC URNs (deprecated by OGC)

    -  PROJ.4 definitions

    -  well known names, such as NAD27, NAD83, WGS84 or WGS72.

    -  WKT in ESRI format, prefixed with "ESRI::"

    -  "IGNF:xxx" and "+init=IGNF:xxx", etc.

    - Since recently (v1.10), GDAL also supports OGC CRS URLs, OGC's preferred
      way of identifying CRSs.

- ``boundsOut`` - geographic bounding box of the projected output, given in the
  same format as ``boundsIn``. This can be "smaller" than the input bounding box,
  in which case the input will be cropped.

- ``crsOut`` - geographic CRS of the result, in same format as ``crsIn``.

- ``widthOut``, ``heightOut`` - integer grid extents of the result; the result
  will be accordingly scaled to fit in these extents.

- ``xres``, ``yres`` - axis resolution in target georeferenced units.

.. _sec-geo-projection-interpolation:

- ``resampleAlg`` - resampling algorithm to use, equivalent to the ones in GDAL:

   near
       Nearest neighbour (default, fastest algorithm, worst interpolation quality).

   bilinear
       Bilinear resampling (2x2 kernel).

   cubic
       Cubic convolution approximation (4x4 kernel).

   cubicspline
       Cubic B-spline approximation (4x4 kernel).

   lanczos
       Lanczos windowed sinc (6x6 kernel).

   average
       Average of all non-NODATA contributing pixels. (GDAL >= 1.10.0)

   mode
       Selects the value which appears most often of all the sampled points.
       (GDAL >= 1.10.0)

   max
       Selects the maximum value from all non-NODATA contributing pixels.
       (GDAL >= 2.0.0)

   min
       Selects the minimum value from all non-NODATA contributing pixels.
       (GDAL >= 2.0.0)

   med
       Selects the median value of all non-NODATA contributing pixels.
       (GDAL >= 2.0.0)

   q1
       Selects the first quartile value of all non-NODATA contributing pixels.
       (GDAL >= 2.0.0)

   q3
       Selects the third quartile value of all non-NODATA contributing pixels.
       (GDAL >= 2.0.0)

- ``errThreshold`` - error threshold for transformation approximation
  (in pixel units - defaults to 0.125).

**Example**

The following expression projects the MDD ``worldMap`` with bounding box
"-180, -90, 180, 90" in CRS EPSG 4326, into EPSG 54030: ::

    project( worldMap, "-180, -90, 180, 90", "EPSG:4326", "EPSG:54030" )

The next example reprojects a subset of MDD ``Formosat`` with geographic
bbox "265725, 2544015, 341595, 2617695" in EPSG 32651, to bbox
"120.630936455 23.5842129067 120.77553782 23.721772322" in EPSG 4326 fit into
a 256 x 256 pixels area. The resampling algorithm is set to bicubic, and the
pixel error threshold is 0.1. ::

    project( Formosat[ 0:2528, 0:2456 ],
      "265725, 2544015, 341595, 2617695", "EPSG:32651",
      "120.630936455 23.5842129067 120.77553782 23.721772322", "EPSG:4326",
      256, 256, cubic, 0.1 )

**Limitations**

Only 2-D arrays are supported. For multiband arrays, all bands must be of the
same cell type.


Notes
^^^^^

Reprojection implies resampling of the cell values into a new grid, hence
usually they will change.

As for the resampling process typically a larger area is required than the
reprojected data area itself, it is advisable to project an area smaller than
the total domain of the MDD.

Per se, rasdaman is a domain-agnostic Array DBMS and, hence, does not
know about CRSs; specific geo semantics is added by rasdaman's petascope
layer. However, for the sake of performance, the
reprojection capability -- which in geo service practice is immensely important
-- is pushed down into rasdaman, rather than doing reprojection in
petascope's Java code. To this end, the ``project()`` function provides rasdaman
with enough information to perform a reprojection, however, without
"knowing" anything in particular about geographic coordinates and CRSs.
One consequence is that there is no check whether this lat/long project is
applied to the proper axis of an array; it is up to the application (usually:
petascope) to handle axis semantics.

.. _ql-guide-clipping:

Clipping Operations
===================

*Clipping* is a general operation covering polygon clipping, linestring
selection, polytope clipping, curtain queries, and corridor queries. Presently,
all operations are available in rasdaman via the ``clip`` function.

Further examples of clipping can be found in the `systemtest for clipping
<http://rasdaman.org/browser/systemtest/testcases_mandatory/test_clipping>`__.

.. _sec-clipping-polygons:

Polygons
--------

Syntax
^^^^^^

::

    select clip( c, polygon(( list of WKT points )) )
    from coll as c

The input consists of an MDD expression and a list of WKT points, which
determines the set of vertices of the polygon. Polygons are assumed to be closed
with positive area, so the first vertex need not be repeated at the end, but
there is no problem if it is. The algorithms used support polygons with
self-intersection and vertex re-visitation.

Polygons may have interiors defined, such as ::

    polygon( ( 0 0, 9 0, 9 9, 0 9, 0 0),
             ( 3 3, 7 3, 7 7, 3 7, 3 3 ) )

which would describe the annular region of the box ``[0:9,0:9]`` with the
interior box ``[3:7,3:7]`` removed. In this case, the interior polygons (there
may be many, as it forms a list) must not intersect the exterior polygon.

Multipolygons
-------------

Syntax
^^^^^^

::

    select clip( c, multipolygon((( list of WKT points )),(( list of WKT points ))...) )
    from coll as c

The input consists of an MDD expression and a list of polygons defined by list of WKT points.
The assumptions about polygons are same as the ones for Polygon.


Return type
^^^^^^^^^^^

The output of a polygon query is a new array with dimensions corresponding to
the bounding box of the polygon vertices, and further restricted to the
collection's spatial domain.
In case of Multipolygon, the new array have dimensions corresponding to closure
of bounding boxes of every individual polygon, which domain intersects the collection's spatial domain.
The data in the array consists of null values where
cells lie outside the polygon (or 0 values if no null values are associated with
the array) and otherwise consists of the data in the
collection where the corresponding cells lie inside the polygon. This could
change the null values stored outside the polygon from one null value to another
null value, in case a range of null values is used. By default, the first
available null value will be utilized for the complement of the polygon.

An illustrative example of a polygon clipping is the right triangle with
vertices located at ``(0,0,0)``, ``(0,10,0)`` and ``(0,10,10)``, which can be
selected via the following query: ::

    select clip( c, polygon((0 0 0, 0 10 0, 0 10 10)) )
    from coll as c

Oblique polygons with subspacing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case all the points in a polygon are coplanar, in some MDD object ``d`` of
higher dimension than 2, users can first perform a subspace operation on ``d``
which selects the 2-D oblique subspace of ``d`` containing the polygon. For
example, if the polygon is the triangle ``polygon((0 0 0, 1 1 1, 0 1 1, 0 0 0))``,
this triangle can be selected via the following query: ::

    select clip( subspace(d, (0 0 0, 1 1 1, 0 1 1) ),
                 polygon(( 0 0, 1 1 , 0 1 , 0 0)) )
    from coll as d

where the result of ``subspace(d)`` is used as the domain of the polygon. For
more information look in :ref:`sec-clipping-subspace`.

.. _sec-clipping-linestrings:

Linestrings
-----------

Syntax
^^^^^^

::

    select clip( c, linestring( list of WKT points ) ) [ with coordinates ]
    from coll as c

The input parameter ``c`` refers to an MDD expression of dimension equal to the
dimension of the points in the list of WKT points. The list of WKT points
consists of parameters such as ``linestring(0 0, 19 -3, 19 -21)``, which would
describe the 3 endpoints of 2 line segments sharing an endpoint at ``19 -3``, in
this case.

Return type
^^^^^^^^^^^

The output consists of a 1-D MDD object consisting of the points selected along
the path drawn out by the linestring. The points are selected using a Bresenham
Line Drawing algorithm which passes through the spatial domain in the MDD
expression ``c``, and selects values from the stored object. In case the
linestring spends some time outside the spatial domain of ``c``, the first
null value will be used to fill the result of the linestring, just as in polygon
clipping.

When ``with coordinates`` is specified, in addition to the original cell values
the coordinate values are also added to the result MDD. The result cell type for
clipped MDD of dimension N will be composite of the following form:

1. If the original cell type ``elemtype`` is non-composite: ::

    { long d1, ..., long dN, elemtype value }

2. Otherwise, if the original cell type is composite of ``M`` bands: ::

    { long d1, ..., long dN, elemtype1 elemname1, ..., elemetypeM elemnameM }


Example
^^^^^^^

Select a Linestring from rgb data ``with coordinates``. First two values of each
cell in the result are the x/y coordinates, with following values (three in this
case for RGB data) are the cell values of the clip operation to which
``with coordinates`` is applied. ::

    select encode(
        clip( c, linestring(0 19, 19 24, 12 17) ) with coordinates, "json")
    from rgb as c

Result::

    ["0 19 119 208 248","1 19 119 208 248","2 20 119 208 248", ...]

The same query without specifying ``with coordinates``: ::

    select encode(
        clip( c, linestring(0 19, 19 24, 12 17) ), "json")
    from rgb as c

results in ::

    ["119 208 248","119 208 248","119 208 248", ...]



.. _sec-clipping-curtains:

Curtains
--------

Syntax
^^^^^^

::

    select clip( c, curtain( projection(dimension pair),
                             polygon(( ... )) ) )
    from coll as c

and ::

    select clip( c, curtain( projection(dimension list),
                             linestring( ... ) ) )
    from coll as c

The input in both variants consists of a dimension list corresponding to the
dimensions in which the geometric object, either the polygon or the linestring,
is defined. The geometry object is defined as per the above descriptions;
however, the following caveat applies: the spatial domain of the mdd expression
is projected along the projection dimensions in the ``projection(dimension
list)``. For a polygon clipping, which is 2-D, the dimension list is a pair of
values such as ``projection(0, 2)`` which would define a polygon in the axial
dimensions of 0 and 2 of the MDD expression ``c``. For instance, if the spatial
domain of ``c`` is ``[0:99,0:199,0:255]``, then this would mean the domain upon
which the polygon is defined would be ``[0:99,0:255]``.

Return type
^^^^^^^^^^^

The output consists of a polygon clipping at every slice of the spatial domain
of ``c``. For instance, if the projection dimensions of ``(0, 2)`` are used for
the same spatial domain of ``c`` above, then a polygon clipping is performed at
every slice of ``c`` of the form ``[0:99,x,0:255]`` and appended to the result
MDD object, where there is a slice for each value of x in ``[0:199]``.


.. _sec-clipping-corridors:

Corridors
---------

Syntax
^^^^^^

::

    select clip( c, corridor( projection(dimension pair),
                              linestring( ... ),
                              polygon(( ... )) ) )
    from coll as c

and ::

    select clip( c, corridor( projection(dimension pair),
                              linestring( ... ),
                              polygon(( ... )),
                              discrete ) )
    from coll as c

The input consists of a dimension list corresponding to the dimensions in which
the geometric object, in this case a polygon, is defined. The linestring
specifies the path along which this geometric object is integrated. One slice is
sampled at every point, and at least the first point of the linestring should be
contained within the polygon to ensure a meaningful result (an error is thrown
in case it is not). There is an optional *discrete* flag which modifies the
output by skipping the extrapolation of the linestring data to interior points.

Return type
^^^^^^^^^^^
The output consists of a polygon clipping at every slice of the spatial domain
of ``c`` translated along the points in the linestring, where the first axis of
the result is indexed by the linestring points and the latter axes are indexed
by the mask dimensions (in this case, the convex hull of the polygon). The
projection dimensions are otherwise handled as in curtains; it is the spatial
offsets given by the linestring coordinates which impact the changes in the
result. In the case where the *discrete* parameter was utilized, the output is
indexed by the number of points in the linestring description in the query and
not by the extrapolated linestring, which uses a Bresenham algorithm to find
the grid points in between.


.. _sec-clipping-subspace:

Subspace Queries
----------------

Here we cover the details of subspace queries in rasdaman. Much like slicing via
a query such as ::

    select c[0:9,1,0:9] from collection as c

the subspace query parameter allows users to extract a lower-dimensional dataset
from an existing collection. It is capable of everything that a slicing query is
capable of, and more. The limitation of slicing is that the selected data must
lie either parallel or perpendicular to existing axes; however, with subspacing,
users can arbitrarily rotate the axes of interest to select data in an oblique
fashion. This control is exercised by defining an affine subspace from a list of
vertices lying in the datacube. Rasdaman takes these points and finds the unique
lowest-dimensional affine subspace containing them, and outputs the data closest
to this slice, contained in the bounding box of the given points, into the
resulting array.

Structure of the query: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(list of WKT points) )
    from coll as c

We can illustrate the usage with an example of two queries which are identical
in output: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 1 0 0, 0 0 1) ) from coll as c

    select c[0:1,0,0:1] from coll as c

This example will result in 1D array of sdom ``[0:99]``: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(19 0, 0 99) ) from test_rgb as c

This example will result in a a 2D array of sdom ``[0:7,0:19]``: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 0 19 0, 7 0 7) )
    from test_grey3d as c

and it will consist of the best integer lattice points reachable by the vectors
``(1,0,1)`` and ``(0,1,0)`` within the bounding box domain of ``[0:7,0:19,0:7]``
in ``test_grey3d``.

Generally speaking, rasdaman uses the 1st point as a basepoint for an affine
subspace containing all given points, constructs a system of equations to
determine whether or not a point is in that subspace or not, and then searches
the bounding box of the given points for solutions to the projection operator
which maps ``[0:7,0:19,0:7]`` to ``[0:7,0:19]``. The result dimensions are
chosen such that each search yields a unique real solution, and then rasdaman
rounds to the nearest integer cell before adding the value stored in that cell
to the result object.

**Some mathematical edge cases:**

Because of arithmetic on affine subspaces, the following two queries are
fundamentally identical to rasdaman: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 1 1 0, 0 1 0) )
    from test_grey3d as c

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 1 0 0, 0 1 0) )
    from test_grey3d as c

Rasdaman's convention is to use the first point as the translation point, and
constructs the vectors generating the subspace from the differences. There is no
particular reason not to use another point in the WKT list; however, knowing
this, users should be aware that affine subspaces differ slightly from vector
subspaces in that the following two queries differ: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(10 10 10, 0 0 10, 10 0 10) )
    from test_grey3d as c

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 10 10 0, 0 10 0) )
    from test_grey3d as c

The two queries have the same result domains of ``[0:10,0:10]``, and the projection
for both lie on the first 2 coordinate axes since the 3rd coordinate remains
constant; however, the data selections differ because the subspaces generated by
these differ, even though the generating vectors of ``(1 1 0)`` and ``(0 1 0)``
are the same.

Even though the bounding box where one searches for solutions is the same
between these two queries, there is no way to reach the origin with the vectors
``(1 1 0)`` and ``(0 1 0)`` starting at the base point of ``(10 10 10)`` because
neither vector can impact the 3rd coordinate value of 10; similarly, starting at
``(0 0 0)`` must leave the third coordinate fixed at 0. There is nothing special
about choosing the first coordinate as our base point -- the numbers might
change, but the resulting data selections in both queries would remain constant.

The following two queries generate the same subspace, but the latter has a
larger output domain: ::

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 1 1 0, 0 1 0) )
    from test_grey3d as c

    select clip( c, subspace(0 0 0, 1 1 0, 0 1 0, 0 0 0, 1 2 0) )
    from test_grey3d as c

As much redundancy as possible is annihilated during a preprocessing stage which
uses a Gram-Schmidt procedure to excise extraneous data imported during query
time, and with this algorithm, rasdaman is able to determine the correct
dimension of the output domain.

**Some algorithmic caveats:**

The complexity of searching for a solution for each result cell is related to
the codimension of the affine subspace, and not the dimension of the affine
subspace itself. In fact, if ``k`` is the difference between the dimension of the
collection array and the dimension of the result array, then each cell is
determined in O(k^2) time. Preprocessing happens once for the entire query,
and occurs in O(k^3) time. There is one exception to the codimensionality
considerations: a 1-D affine subspace (also known as a line segment) is selected
using a multidimensional generalization of the Bresenham Line Algorithm, and so
the results are determined in O(n) time, where n is the dimension of the
collection.

Tip: If you want a slice which is parallel to axes, then you are better off
using the classic slicing style of: ::

    select c[0:19,0:7,0] from collection as c

as the memory offset computations are performed much more efficiently.


.. _induced-operations:

Induced Operations
==================

Induced operations allow to simultaneously apply a function originally
working on a single cell value to all cells of an MDD. The result MDD
has the same spatial domain, but can change its base type.

**Examples**

::

    img.green + 5 c

This expression selects component named "green" from an RGB image and
adds 5 (of type char, i.e., 8 bit) to every pixel. ::

    img1 + img2

This performs pixelwise addition of two images (which must be of equal
spatial domain).

**Induction and structs**

Whenever induced operations are applied to a composite cell structure
("structs" in C/C++), then the induced operation is executed on every
structure component. If some cell structure component turns out to be of
an incompatible type, then the operation as a whole aborts with an
error.

For example, a constant can be added simultaneously to all components of
an RGB image: ::

    select rgb + 5
    from rgb

**Induction and complex**

Complex numbers, which actually form a composite type supported as a
base type, can be accessed with the record component names re and im for
the real and the imaginary part, resp.

**Example**

The first expression below extracts the real component, the second one
the imaginary part from a complex number c: ::

    c.re
    c.im


Unary Induction
---------------

Unary induction means that only one array operand is involved in the
expression. Two situations can occur: Either the operation is unary by
nature (such as boolean not); then, this operation is applied to each
array cell. Or the induce operation combines a single value (scalar)
with the array; then, the contents of each cell is combined with the
scalar value.

A special case, syntactically, is the struct/complex component selection (see
next subsection).

In any case, sequence of iteration through the array for cell inspection
is chosen by the database server (which heavily uses reordering for
query optimisation) and not known to the user.

**Syntax**

::

    unaryOp mddExp
    mddExp binaryOp scalarExp
    scalarExp binaryOp mddExp


**Example**

The red images of collection rgb with all pixel values multiplied by 2: ::

    select rgb.red * 2c
    from rgb

Note that the constant is marked as being of type char so that the result type
is minimized (short). Omitting the "``c``" would lead to an addition of long
integer and char, resulting in long integer with 32 bit per pixel. Although
pixel values obviously are the same in both cases, the second alternative
requires twice the memory space. For more details visit the
:ref:`type-coercion` section.

.. _sec-struct-component-sel:

Struct Component Selection
--------------------------

Component selection from a composite value is done with the dot operator
well-known from programming languages. The argument can either be a
number (starting with 0) or the struct element name. Both statements of
the following example would select the green plane of the sample RGB
image.

This is a special case of a unary induced operator.

**Syntax**

::

    mddExp.attrName

   RGB image and green component


**Note**

Aside of operations involving base types such as integer and boolean,
combination of complex base types (structs) with scalar values are
supported. In this case, the operation is applied to each element of the
structure in turn.


**Examples**

The following expression reduces contrast of a color image in its red,
green, and blue channel simultaneously: ::

    select rgb / 2c
    from rgb

An advanced example is to use image properties for masking areas in this
image. In the query below, this is done by searching pixels which are
"sufficiently green" by imposing a lower bound on the green intensity
and upper bounds on the red and blue intensity. The resulting boolean
matrix is multiplied with the original image (i.e., componentwise with
the red, green, and blue pixel component); the final image, then, shows
the original pixel value where green prevails and is {0,0,0} (i.e.,
black) otherwise (\ :numref:`figure11`\ ) ::

    select rgb * ( (rgb.green > 130c) and
                   (rgb.red   < 110c) and
                   (rgb.blue  < 140c) )
    from rgb

   Suppressing "non-green" areas

.. note::
    This mixing of boolean and integer is possible because the usual C/C++
    interpretation of true as 1 and false as 0 is supported by rasql.

.. _sec-binary-induction:

Binary Induction
----------------

Binary induction means that two arrays are combined.

**Syntax**

::

    mddExp binaryOp mddExp

**Example**

The difference between the images in the ``mr`` collection and the image in
the ``mr2`` collection: ::

    select mr - mr2
    from mr, mr2


**Note**

Two cases have to be distinguished:

-  Both left hand array expression and right hand array expression
   operate on the same array, for example: ::

    select rgb.red - rgb.green
    from rgb

   In this case, the expression is evaluated by combining, for each
   coordinate position, the respective cell values from the left hand and
   right hand side.

-  Left hand array expression and right hand array expression operate on
   different arrays, for example: ::

    select mr - mr2
    from mr, mr2

   This situation specifies a cross product between the two collections
   involved. During evaluation, each array from the first collection is
   combined with each member of the second collection. Every such pair of
   arrays then is processed as described above.

Obviously the second case can become computationally very expensive,
depending on the size of the collections involved - if the two
collections contain n and m members, resp., then n*m combinations have
to be evaluated.

.. _rasql-case-stmt:

Case statement
--------------

The rasdaman **case** statement serves to model n-fold case distinctions
based on the SQL92 CASE statement which essentially represents a list of
IF-THEN statements evaluated sequentially until either a condition fires
and delivers the corresponding result or the (mandatory) ELSE
alternative is returned.

In the simplest form, the **case** statement looks at a variable and
compares it to different alternatives for finding out what to deliver.
The more involved version allows general predicates in the condition.

This functionality is implemented in rasdaman on both scalars (where it
resembles SQL) and on MDD objects (where it establishes an induced
operation). Due to the construction of the rasql syntax, the distinction
between scalar and induced operations is not reflected explicitly in the
syntax, making query writing simpler.

**Syntax**

-  Variable-based variant: ::

    case generalExp
    when scalarExp then generalExp
    ...
    else generalExp
    end

   All *generalExp*\ s must be of a compatible type.

-  Expression-based variant: ::

    case
    when booleanExp then generalExp
    ...
    else generalExp
    end

  All *generalExp*'s must evaluate to a compatible type.


**Example**

Traffic light classification of an array object can be done as follows. ::

    select
      case
      when mr > 150 then { 255c, 0c, 0c }
      when mr > 100 then { 0c, 255c, 0c }
      else               { 0c, 0c, 255c }
      end
    from mr

This is equivalent to the following query; note that this query is less
efficient due to the increased number of operations to be evaluated,
the expensive multiplications, etc: ::

    select
      (mr > 150)                { 255c, 0c, 0c }
    + (mr <= 150 and mr > 100)  { 0c, 255c, 0c }
    + (mr <= 100)               { 0c, 0c, 255c }
    from mr


**Restrictions**

In the current version, all MDD objects participating in a **case**
statement must have the same tiling. Note that this limitation can often
be overcome by factoring divergingly tiled arrays out of a query, or by
resorting to the query equivalent in the above example using
multiplication and addition.

.. _induction-all-ops:

Induction: All Operations
-------------------------

Below is a complete listing of all cell level operations that can be induced,
both unary and binary. Supported operand types and rules for deriving the result
types for each operation are specified in :ref:`type-coercion`.

+, -, \*, /
    For each cell within some MDD value (or evaluated MDD expression), add
    it with the corresponding cell of the second MDD parameter. For example,
    this code adds two (equally sized) images: ::

        img1 + img2

div, mod
    In contrast to the previous operators, div and mod are binary functions.
    The difference of ``div`` to ``/`` is that in the case of integer inputs,
    ``div`` results in integer result, and hence must check for division with 0,
    in which case an error would be thrown. The behaviour of ``mod`` is the same.
    Example usage: ::

        div(a, b)
        mod(a, b)

pow, power
    The power function can be written as ``pow`` or ``power``. The signature
    is: ::

        pow( base, exp )

    where *base* is an MDD or scalar and *exp* is a floating point number.

=, <, >, <=, >=, !=
    For two MDD values (or evaluated MDD expressions), compare for each
    coordinate the corresponding cells to obtain the Boolean result
    indicated by the operation.

    These comparison operators work on all atomic cell types.

    On composite cells, only ``=`` and ``!=`` are supported; both operands must have
    a compatible cell structure. In this case, the comparison result is the
    conjunction ("and" connection) of the pairwise comparison of all cell
    components.

and, or, xor, is, not
    For each cell within some Boolean MDD (or evaluated MDD expression),
    combine it with the second MDD argument using the logical operation ``and``,
    ``or``, or ``xor``. The ``is`` operation is equivalent to ``=`` (see below). The
    signature of the binary induced operation is ::

        is, and, or, xor: mddExp, intExp -> mddExp

    Unary function ``not`` negates each cell value in the MDD.

min, max
    For two MDD values (or evaluated MDD expressions), take the minimum /
    maximum for each pair of corresponding cell values in the MDDs.

    Example: ::

        a min b

    For struct valued MDD values, struct components in the MDD operands must
    be pairwise compatible; comparison is done in lexicographic order with
    the first struct component being most significant and the last component
    being least significant.

overlay
    The overlay operator allows to combine two equally sized MDDs by placing
    the second one "on top" of the first one, informally speaking. Formally,
    overlaying is done in the following way:

    -  wherever the second operand's cell value is not zero and not null,
       the result value will be this value.

    -  wherever the second operand's cell value is zero or null, the first
       argument's cell value will be taken.

    This way stacking of layers can be accomplished, e.g., in geographic
    applications. Consider the following example: ::

        ortho overlay tk.water overlay tk.streets

    When displayed the resulting image will have streets on top, followed by
    water, and at the bottom there is the ortho photo.

    Strictly speaking, the overlay operator is not atomic. Expression ::

        a overlay b

    is equivalent to ::

        (b is not null) * b + (b is null) * a

    However, on the server the overlay operator is executed more efficiently
    than the above expression.

bit(mdd, pos)
    For each cell within MDD value (or evaluated MDD expression) mdd, take
    the bit with nonnegative position number pos and put it as a Boolean
    value into a byte. Position counting starts with 0 and runs from least
    to most significant bit. The bit operation signature is ::

        bit: mddExp, intExp -> mddExp

    In C/C++ style, ``bit(mdd, pos)`` is equivalent to ``mdd >> pos & 1``.

Arithmetic, trigonometric, and exponential functions
    The following advanced arithmetic functions are available with the
    obvious meaning, each of them accepting an MDD object: ::

        abs()
        sqrt()
        exp() log() ln()
        sin() cos() tan()
        sinh() cosh() tanh()
        arcsin() arccos() arctan()

    **Exceptions**

    Generally, on domain error or other invalid cell values these functions will
    not throw an error, but result in NaN or similar according to IEEE
    floating-point arithmetic. Internally the rasdaman implementation calls the
    corresponding C++ functions, so the C++ documentation applies.

cast
    Sometimes the desired ultimate scalar type or MDD cell type is different
    from what the MDD expression would suggest. To this end, the result type
    can be enforced explicitly through the cast operator.

    The syntax is: ::

        (newType) generalExp

    where newType is the desired result type of expression generalExp.

    Like in programming languages, the cast operator converts the result to
    the desired type if this is possible at all. For example, the following
    scalar expression, without cast, would return a double precision float
    value; the cast makes it a single precision value: ::

        (float) avg_cells( mr )

    Both scalar values and MDD can be cast; in the latter case, the cast
    operator is applied to each cell of the MDD yielding an array over the
    indicated type.

    The cast operator also works properly on composite cell structures. In such
    a case, the cast type is applied to every component of the cell. For
    example, the following expression converts the pixel type of an (3x8 bit)
    RGB image to an image where each cell is a structure with three long
    components: ::

        (long) rgb

    Obviously in the result structure all components will bear the same type.
    In addition, the target type can be a user-defined composite type, e.g. the
    following will cast the operand to `{1c, 2c, 3c}`:

        (RGBPixel) {1c, 2l, 3.0}

    **Casting from larger to smaller integer type**

    If the new type is smaller than the value's type, i.e. not all values can
    be represented by it, then standard C++ casting will typically lead to
    strange results due to wrap around for unsigned and implementation-defined
    behavior for a signed types. For example, casting int 1234 to char in C++
    will result in 210, while the possible range would be 0 - 255.

    Rasdaman implements a more reasonable cast behavior in this case: if the
    value is larger than the maximum value representable by the new type, then
    the result is the maximum value (e.g. 255 in the previous example);
    analogously, if the value is smaller than the minimum possible value, then
    the result is the minimum value.

    This is implemented only on integer types and entails a small performance
    penalty in comparison to raw C++ as up to two comparisons per cell (with
    the maximum and minimum) are necessary when casting.

**Restrictions**

On base type complex, only the following operations are available right
now:

::

    + - * /


Scaling
=======

Shorthand functions are available to scale multidimensional objects.
They receive an array as parameter, plus a scale indicator. In the most
common case, the scaling factor is an integer or float number. This
factor then is applied to all dimensions homogeneously. For a scaling
with individual factors for each dimension, a scaling vector can be
supplied which, for each dimension, contains the resp. scale factor.
Alternatively, a target domain can be specified to which the object gets
scaled.

**Syntax**

::

    scale( mddExp, intExp )
    scale( mddExp, floatExp )
    scale( mddExp, intVector )
    scale( mddExp, mintervalExp )


**Examples**

The following example returns all images of collection ``mr`` where each
image has been scaled down by a factor of 2. ::

    select scale( mr, 0.5 )
    from mr

Next, mr images are enlarged by 4 in the first dimension and 3 in the
second dimension: ::

    select scale( mr, [ 4, 3 ] )
    from mr

In the final example, mr images are scaled to obtain 100x100 thumbnails
(note that this can break aspect ratio): ::

    select scale( mr, [ 0:99, 0:99 ] )
    from mr


.. note::
    Function ``scale()`` breaks tile streaming, it needs to load all tiles
    affected into server main memory. In other words, the source argument of
    the function must fit into server main memory. Consequently, it is not
    advisable to use this function on very large items.

.. note::
    Currently only nearest neighbour interpolation is supported for scaling.


Concatenation
=============

Concatenation of two arrays "glues" together arrays by lining them up
along an axis.

This can be achieved with a shorthand function, ``concat``, which for
convenience is implemented as an n-ary operator accepting an unlimited number of
arrays of the same base type. The operator takes the input arrays, lines them up
along the concatenation dimension specified in the request, and outputs one
result array. To this end, each input array is shifted to the appropriate
position, with the first array's position remaining unchanged; therefore, it is
irrelevant whether array extents, along the concatenation dimension, are
disjoint, overlapping, or containing each other.

The resulting array's dimensionality is equal to the input array dimensionality.

The resulting array extent is the sum of all extents along the concatenation
dimension, and the extent of the input arrays in all other dimensions.

The resulting array cell type is same as the cell types of the input arrays.

**Constraints**

All participating arrays must have the same number of dimensions.

All participating arrays must have identical extents in all dimensions, except
that dimension along which concatenation is performed.

Input arrays must have the same cell types, i.e. concatenating a char and float
arrays is not possible and requires explicit casting to a common type.

**Syntax**

::

    concat mddExp with mddExp ... with mddExp along integer

**Examples**

The following query returns the concatenation of all images of
collection mr with themselves along the first dimension (\ :numref:`figure12`\ ). ::

    select concat mr with mr along 0
    from mr

.. _figure12:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image24.jpg
   :align: center

   Query result of single concatenation

The next example returns a 2x2 arrangement of images (\ :numref:`figure13`\ ): ::

    select concat (concat mr with mr along 0)
    with (concat mr with mr along 0)
    along 1
    from mr

.. _figure13:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image25.jpg
   :align: center

   Query result of multiple concatenation

.. _condensers:

Condensers
==========

Frequently summary information of some kind is required about some
array, such as sum or average of cell values. To accomplish this, rasql
provides the concept of condensers.

A condense operation (or short: condenser) takes an array and
summarizes its values using a summarization function, either to a
scalar value (e.g. computing the sum of all its cells), or to another
array (e.g. summarizing a 3-D cube into a 2-D image by adding all the
horizontal slices that the cube is composed of).

A number of condensers is provided as rasql built-in functions.

- For *numeric* arrays, ``add_cells()`` delivers the sum and ``avg_cells()`` the
  average of all cell values. Operators ``min_cells()`` and ``max_cells()``
  return the minimum and maximum, resp., of all cell values in the argument
  array. ``stddev_pop``, ``stddev_samp``, ``var_pop``, and ``var_samp`` allow to
  calculate the population and sample standard deviation, as well as the
  population and sample variance of the MDD cells.

- For *boolean* arrays, the condenser ``count_cells()`` counts the cells
  containing ``true``; ``some_cells()`` operation returns true if at
  least one cell of the boolean MDD is ``true``, ``all_cells()`` returns true if
  all of the MDD cells contain ``true`` as value.

Please keep in mind that, depending on their nature, operations take a
boolean, numeric, or arbitrary *mddExp* as argument.

**Syntax**

::

    count_cells( mddExp )
    add_cells( mddExp )
    avg_cells( mddExp )
    min_cells( mddExp )
    max_cells( mddExp )
    some_cells( mddExp )
    all_cells( mddExp )
    stddev_pop( mddExp )
    stddev_samp( mddExp )
    var_pop( mddExp )
    var_samp( mddExp )


**Examples**

The following example returns all images of collection ``mr`` where all
pixel values are greater than 20. Note that the induction "``>20``"
generates a boolean array which, then, can be collapsed into a single
boolean value by the condenser. ::

    select mr
    from mr
    where all_cells( mr > 20 )


The next example selects all images of collection ``mr`` with at least one
pixel value greater than 250 in region ``[ 120:160, 55:75]`` (\ :numref:`figure14`\ ). ::

    select mr
    from mr
    where some_cells( mr[120 : 160, 55 : 75] > 250 )

.. _figure14:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image4.jpg
   :align: center
   :scale: 80%

   Query result of specific selection


Finally, this query calculates the sample variance of ``mr2``:

    select var_samp( mr2 )
    from mr2


.. _sec-sort:

SORT operator
=============

The ``SORT`` operator allows to sort the slices along a given axis of an array.
This is done by calculating a rank value for each of the slices according to a
given *ranking function*, and then reordering the slices according to their
ranks in ascending (by default) or descending order.


**Syntax**

::

  	SORT generalExp
    ALONG sortAxis AS sortAxisIterator [listingOrder]
    BY cellExp

Where

.. code-block:: text

    sortAxis: integerLit | identifier
    sortAxisIterator: identifier
    listingOrder: ASC | DESC


The ``generalExp`` denotes the array to be sorted; arrays of any dimensionality
and type can be specified, or expressions that produce an array.

The ``sortAxis`` along which the array is sliced and reordered is specified in
the ``ALONG`` clause. It can be specified by axis name according to the MDD
type definition (e.g. x, y, Lat, ...), or by an integer indicating its 0-based
order (0 for the first axis, 1 for the second, and so on). Additionally a
``sortAxisIterator`` must be specified as an alias for addressing the axis in
the ranking function, e.g. in subsetting the ``generalExp`` into slices and
aggregating each into a rank. Depending on the optional ``listingOrder`` the
slices are sorted in ascending ``ASC`` (default if not specified) or descending
``DESC`` order.

The ``cellExp`` in the ``BY`` clause is the slice ranking function. It must
result in an atomic scalar value for each point in the sort axis extent. Slices
for which the same rank is calculated retain their relative order as in the
input array (stable sorting). The ``sortAxisIterator`` can be used to reference
the points along the ``sortAxis``.

The mechanics of the SORT expressions is perhaps more clearly explained via an
equivalence to an MARRAY constructor expression, which creates a 1D array of
ranks calculated by the ``cellExp`` for each point in the 1D domain created by
the extend of the ``sortAxis``; then SORT sorts these ranks and the slices to
which they correspond in ascending or descending order. For example, if A is
a 3D array and we have the a SORT expression that reorders the slices along the
first axis by their average values:

::

    SORT A
    ALONG 0 AS sortAxis
    BY avg_cells( A[ sortAxis[0], *:*, *:* ] )

then before the sorting is applied, first the ranks for each slice are
calculated with an MARRAY:

::

    MARRAY sortAxis in [ sdom(A)[0].lo : sdom(A)[0].hi ]
    VALUES avg_cells( A[ sortAxis[0], *:*, *:* ] )

The sorting causes no change in the spatial domain, base type, or dimensionality
in the result.


**Examples**

The following examples illustrate the syntax of the ``SORT`` operator; 
``raster2D`` and ``raster3D`` are 2D and 3D MDDs with axes x/y and t/x/y
respectively.

.. hidden-code-block:: rasql

    SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS i
    BY raster2D[i[0], 1]

    SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS i
    BY add_cells(raster2D[i[0], *:*])

    SORT raster2D ALONG x AS i
    BY add_cells(raster2D[i[0], *:*])

    SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS n DESC
    BY add_cells(raster2D[n[0], 0:100])

    SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS i
    BY add_cells(raster2D[i[0], *:*]) - raster2D[i[0], 0]

    SORT raster3D ALONG t AS time DESC
    BY max_cells(raster3D[time[0], *:*, *:*])


The following examples show the semantics of the sort operator. Array cells
which contribute to the rank result are highlighted in red.

The following example shows how a 10x3 array of double floating-point values is
sorted along its second axis in an ascending order by the minimum of all values
in each slice. ::

The array looks as follows before and after sorting:

   :align: center
   :width: 50%

   Minimum values in columns 0,1,2 are 8, 3.26, and 14.8 respectively,
   highlighted in red.

We observe that the sorting was a reordering of the slices along the second
axis, represented by the columns.

By subsetting along an axis other than the ``sortAxis``, we can further restrict
areas in the slices which contribute to the ranking function. For example, the
following 2 queries consider only the value at index positions 0 or 1,
respectively, along axis 1. ::

	SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS i
  BY (raster2D2[i[0], 0])

	SORT raster2D ALONG 0 AS i
  BY (raster2D2[i[0], 1])

The next example, shows how a 3D array of double floating-point values for
temperature is sorted along its first axis of time in a descending order, by
the maximum temperature value in each latitude/longitude combination: ::

	SORT weather ALONG 0 AS i DESC
  BY max_cells(weather[i[0], *:*, *:*])


The datasheet looks as follows:

.. image:: media/ql-guide/gcoos5double.png
   :width: 100%

The first datasheet represents all the data that we have. The second offers a
datacube interpretation of the available data. The first dimension is time, the
second the latitude, and the third represents the longitude. In this example,
the lat/lon are limited to 3 entries each. And the temperature is recorded at
11 unique timestamps. Thus, the data is represented using the available
combinations of longitude and latitude (25.084,-81.096),(27.601,-82.751) and
(30.4367,-88.0117), by (0,0), (1,1) and (2,2) respectively, each in their
timestamp. All the cell values are recorded temperatures.

The following illustration represents a 3D array holding this data:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/gcoos5Normal.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%

On the first timestamp, for instance, we have a temperature measurement of 18.05
degrees, for lat/lon (2,2), which represents (30.4367,-88.0117) of the original
table. In the last timestamp, we have two temperature records, at (0,0) and at 
(1,1). If we had more measurements, they would fill in the zero-values.

After sorting, the array looks as follows:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/gcoos5Sorted.png
   :align: center
   :width: 30%

We observe that the time-slices have been sorted by their maximum value, in a
descending manner.

One can also sort by a specific longitude/latitude combination, e.g: ::

	SORT weather ALONG 0 AS i
  BY weather[i[0], 0, 0] DESC

.. _sec-flip:

FLIP operator
===============

The ``FLIP`` operator allows to reverse the values/slices of an MDD along a
particular axis. Similar to ``SORT``, the array is sliced at the chosen axis.
The slices are then reordered in opposite order, resulting in an array
with *no* change in the spatial domain, base type, or dimensionality.

**Syntax**

::

	 FLIP generalExp ALONG flipAxis

Where

.. code-block:: text

    flipAxis: integerLit | identifier

The ``generalExp`` denotes the array argument; arrays of any dimensionality
and type can be specified (or expressions that produce an array).

The ``flipAxis`` along which the array is sliced and reordered in reverse order
is specified in the ``ALONG`` clause. It can be specified by axis name
according to the MDD type definition (e.g. x, y, Lat, ...), or by an integer
indicating its 0-based order (0 for the first axis, 1 for the second, and so
on).


**Examples**

The following examples illustrate the syntax of the ``FLIP`` operator; 
``raster2D`` and ``raster3D`` are 2D and 3D MDDs with axes x/y and time/x/y
respectively.

.. hidden-code-block:: rasql

    FLIP raster2D ALONG 0
    FLIP raster2D ALONG x

    FLIP raster3D ALONG time

The next example illustrates the inversion of the following array:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/flipNormal.png
   :align: center
   :width: 21%

Flipping the array on its first axis with ::

    FLIP raster2D ALONG 0

and flipping on the second axis with ::

    FLIP raster2D ALONG 1

yields the following results, respectively:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/flip.png
   :align: center
   :width: 43%

In a more visual example, applying the FLIP operation on the sample MRT imagery
collection ``mr2`` will mirror the image vertically or horizontally. The
original image looks as follows:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image7.png
   :align: center
   :width: 211px

flipping on the first axis with ::

    FLIP mr2 ALONG 0

results in

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/mrFlipped0.png
   :align: center
   :width: 211px

   the image is mirrored on the vertical axis

and flipping on the second axis with ::

    FLIP mr2 ALONG 1

results in

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/mrFlipped1.png
   :align: center
   :width: 211px

   the image is mirrored on the horizontal axis


.. _sec-condenser:

General Array Condenser
=======================

All the condensers introduced above are special cases of a general
principle which is represented by the *general condenser* statement.

The general condense operation consolidates cell values of a
multidimensional array to a scalar value based on the condensing
operation indicated. It iterates over a spatial domain while combining
the result values of the *cellExp*\ s through the *condenserOp*
indicated.

The general condense operation consolidates cell values of a
multidimensional array to a scalar value or an array, based on the
condensing operation indicated.

Condensers are heavily used in two situations:

-  To collapse boolean arrays into scalar boolean values so that they
   can be used in the **where** clause.

-  In conjunction with the **marray** constructor (see next section) to
   phrase high-level signal processing and statistical operations.

**Syntax**

::

    condense condenserOp
    over var in mintervalExp
    using cellExp

    condense condenserOp
    over var in mintervalExp
    where booleanExp
    using cellExp


The *mintervalExp* terms together span a multidimensional spatial
domain over which the condenser iterates. It visits each point in this
space exactly once, assigns the point's respective coordinates to the
*var* variables and evaluates *cellExp* for the current point. The
result values are combined using condensing function *condenserOp*.
Optionally, points used for the aggregate can be filtered through a
*booleanExp*; in this case, *cellExp* will be evaluated only for those
points where *booleanExp* is true, all others will not be regarded. Both
*booleanExp* and *cellExp* can contain occurrences of variables
*pointVar*.

**Examples**

This expression below returns a scalar representing the sum of all array
values, multiplied by 2 (effectively, this is equivalent to
add_cells(2*a)): ::

    condense +
    over x in sdom(a)
    using 2 * a[ x ]

The following expression returns a 2-D array where cell values of 3-D
array a are added up along the third axis: ::

    condense +
    over x in [0:100]
    using a[ *:*, *:*, x[0] ]

Note that the addition is induced as the result type of the value clause
is an array. This type of operation is frequent, for example, in
satellite image time series analysis where aggregation is performed
along the time axis.

Definition of the specialized condensers in terms of the general
condenser statement is as shown in :numref:`table3`.

**Restriction**

Currently condensers over complex numbers are generally not supported, with
exception of ``add_cells`` and ``avg_cells``.


.. _sec-marray:

General Array Constructor
=========================

The **marray** constructor allows to create n-dimensional arrays with their
content defined by a general expression. This is useful

-  whenever the array is too large to be described as a constant (see
   :ref:`sec-arrayconstant`) or

-  when the array's contents is derived from some other source,
   e.g., for a histogram computation (see examples below).

**Syntax**

The basic shape of the ``marray`` constructor is as follows: ::

    marray var in mintervalExp [, var in mintervalExp]
    values cellExp

The *cellExp* describes how the resulting array is produced at each point of its
domain.

**Iterator Variable Declaration**

The result array is defined by the cross product of all *mintervalExp*. For
example, the following defines a 2-D 5x10 matrix: ::

    marray x in [1:5], y in [1:10]
    values ...

The base type of the array is determined by the type of *cellExp.*
Each variable *var* can be of any number of dimensions.

**Iteration Expression**

The resulting array is filled in at each coordinate of its spatial domain
by successively evaluating *cellExp*; the result value is assigned to the cell
at the coordinate currently under evaluation. To this end, *cellExp* can
contain arbitrary occurrences of *var*, which are accordingly substituted with
the values of the current coordinate. The syntax for using a variable is:

-  for a one-dimensional variable: ::

        var

-  for a one- or higher-dimensional variable: ::

        var [ index-expr ]

where *index-expr* is a constant expression evaluating to a non-negative
integer; this number indicates the variable dimension to be used.

.. _figure15:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figure15.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

   2-D array with values derived from first coordinate


**Examples**

The following creates an array with spatial domain [1:100,-50:200] over
cell type char, each cell being initialized to 1. ::

    marray x in [ 1:100, -50:200 ]
    values 1c

In the next expression, cell values are dependent on the first
coordinate component (cf. :numref:`figure15`\ )::

    marray x in [ 0:255, 0:100 ]
    values x[0]

The final two examples comprise a typical marray/condenser combination.
The first one takes a sales table and consolidates it from days to week
per product. Table structure is as given in :numref:`figure16`\ .::

    select marray tab in [ 0:sdom(s)[0].hi/7, sdom(s)[1] ]
           values condense +
                  over day in [ 0:6 ]
                  using s[ day[0] + tab7 ] , tab[1] ]
    from salestable as s

The last example computes histograms for the mr images. The query
creates a 1-D array ranging from 0 to 9 where each cell contains the
number of pixels in the image having the respective intensity value. ::

    select marray v in [ 0 : 9 ]
           values condense +
                  over x in sdom(mr)
                  where mr[x] = v[0]
                  using 1
    from mr

.. _figure16:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figure16.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

   Sales table consolidation


**Shorthand**

As a shorthand, variable *var* can be used without indexing; this is
equivalent to var[0]: ::

    marray x in [1:5]
    values a[ x ]       -- equivalent to a[ x[0] ]

*Known issue:* the shorthand notation currently works as expected only when one
variable is defined.

**Many vs. One Variable**

Obviously an expression containing several 1-D variables, such as: ::

    marray x in [1:5], y in [1:10]
    values a[ x[0], y[0] ]

can always be rewritten to an equivalent expression using one
higher-dimensional variable, for example: ::

    marray xy in [1:5, 1:10]
    values a[ xy[0], xy[1] ]

**Iteration Sequence Undefined**

The sequence in which the array cells defined by an marray construct are
inspected is not defined. In fact, server optimisation will heavily make
use of reordering traversal sequence to achieve best performance.

**Restriction**

Currently there is a restriction in variable lists: for each marray variable
declaration, either there is only one variable which can be multidimensional, or
there is a list of one-dimensional variables; mixing the two is not allowed.


**A Note on Expressiveness and Performance**

The general condenser and the array constructor together allow
expressing a very broad range of signal processing and statistical
operat­ions. In fact, all other rasql array operations can be expressed
through them, as :numref:`table4` exemplifies. Nevertheless, it is advisable to
use the specialized operations whenever possible; not only are they more
handy and easier to read, but also internally their processing has been
optimized so that they execute considerably faster than the general
phrasing.

.. _type-coercion:

Type Coercion Rules
===================

This section specifies the type coercion rules in query expressions, i.e. how
the base type of the result from an operation applied on operands of various
base types is derived.

The *guiding design principle* for these rules is to minimize the risk for
overflow, but also "type inflation": when a smaller result type is sufficient to
represent all possible values of an operation, then it is preferred over a
larger result type. This is especially important in the context of rasdaman,
where the difference between float and double for example can be multiple GBs or
TBs for large arrays. As such, the rules are somewhat different from C++ for
example or even numpy, where in general careful explicit casting is required
to avoid overflow or overtyping.

Here a summary is presented, while full details can be explored in `rasdaman's
systemtest
<http://rasdaman.org/browser/systemtest/testcases_mandatory/test_type_coercion/oracle>`__.
The type specifiers (c, o, s, ...) are the literal type suffixes as documented
in :numref:`table-literal-type-suffix`; ``X`` and ``Y`` indicate any cell type,
``U`` corresponds to any unsigned integer type, ``S`` to any signed integer
type, ``C`` to any complex type. In every table the upper rows have precedence,
i.e. the deduction rules are ordered; if a particular operand type combination
is missing it means that it is not supported and would lead to a type error. The
first/second operand types are commutative by default and only one direction is
shown to reduce clutter. Types have a *rank* determined by their size in bytes
and signedness, so that double has a higher rank than float, and long has higher
rank than ulong; max/min of two types returns the type with higher/lower type.
Adding 1 to a type results in the next type by rank, preserving signedness; the
integer/floating-point boundary is not crossed, however, i.e. ``long + 1 = long``.

Binary Induced
--------------

Complex operands are only supported by ``+, -, \*, /, div, =, and !=``. If any
operand of these operations is complex, then the result is complex with
underlying type derived by applying the rules to the underlying types of the
inputs. E.g. ``char + CInt16 = char + short = CInt32``, and ``CInt32 * CFloat32
= long * float = CFloat64``.

**+, \*, div, mod**

    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | first     | second     | result                 |
    +===========+============+========================+
    | X         | d          | d                      |
    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | l,ul      | f          | d                      |
    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | X         | f          | f                      |
    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | U1        | U2         | max(U1, U2) + 1        |
    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | X         | Y          | signed(max(X, Y) + 1)  |
    +-----------+------------+------------------------+

**\- (subtraction)**

The result can always be negative, even if inputs are unsigned (positive), so
for integers the result type is always the next greater signed type. Otherwise,
the rules are the same as for +, \*, div, mod.

    +-----------+------------+------------------------+
    | first     | second     | result                 |

Division returns floating-point to avoid inadvertent precision loss as well as
unnecessary check for division by zero. Integer division is supported with the
``div`` function.

.. _format-conversion:

**********************
Data Format Conversion
**********************

Without further indication, arrays are accepted and delivered in the
client's main memory format, regardless of the client and server
architecture. Sometimes, however, it is desirable to use some data
exchange format - be it because some device provides a data stream to be
inserted in to the database in a particular format, or be it a Web
application where particular output formats have to be used to conform
with the respective standards.

To this end, rasql provides two functions for

- `decoding <rasql-decode-function>`__ format-encoded data into an MDD

- `encoding <rasql-encode-function>`__ an MDD to a particular format

Implementation of these functions is based on GDAL and, hence, supports
all GDAL formats. Some formats are implemented natively in addition: NetCDF,
GRIB, JSON, and CSV.


.. _rasql-decode-function:

Decode for data import
======================

The ``decode()`` function allows for decoding data represented in one of
the supported formats, into an MDD which can be persisted or processed in
rasdaman.

Syntax
------

::

    decode( mddExp )

    encode( mddExp , format , formatParameters )


As a first paramater the data to be decoded must be specified. Technically this
data must be in the form of a 1D char array. Usually it is specified as a query
input parameter with ``$1``, while the binary data is attached with the
``--file`` option of the rasql command-line client tool, or with the
corresponding methods in the client API. If the data is on the same machine as
rasdaman, it can be loaded directly by specifying the path to it in the format
parameters; more details on this in :ref:`rasql-decode-format-parameters`.

Data format
-----------

The source data format is automatically detected in case it is handled by GDAL
(e.g. PNG, TIFF, JPEG, etc; see output of ``gdalinfo --formats`` or the `GDAL
documentation <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__ for a full list),
so there is no format parameter in this case.

A format is necessary, however, when a custom internal implementation should be
selected instead of GDAL for decoding the data, e.g. NetCDF (``"netcdf"`` /
``"application/netcdf"``), GRIB (``"grib"``), JSON (``"json"`` /
``"application/json"``), or CSV (``"csv"`` / ``"text/csv"``).


.. _rasql-decode-format-parameters:

Format parameters
-----------------

Optionally, a format parameters string can be specified as a third parameter,
which allows to control the format decoding. For GDAL formats it is necessary to
specify format ``"GDAL"`` in this case.

The format parameters must be formatted as a valid JSON object. As the format
parameters are in quotes, i.e. ``"formatParameters"``, all quotes inside of the
``formatParameters`` need to be escaped (``\"``). For example,
``"{ \"transpose\": [0,1] }"`` is the right way to specify transposition, while
``"{ "transpose": [0,1] }"`` will lead to failure. Note that in examples further
on quotes are not escaped for readability.

Common parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following parameters are common to GDAL, NetCDF, and GRIB data formats:

- ``variables`` -  An array of variable names or band ids (0-based, as strings)
  to be extracted from the data. This allows to decode only some of the
  variables in a NetCDF file for example with ``["var1", "var2"]``, or the bands
  of a TIFF file with ``["0", "2"]``.

- ``filePaths`` - An array of absolute paths to input files to be decoded, e.g.
  ``["/path/to/rgb.tif"]``. This improves ingestion performance if the data is
  on the same machine as the rasdaman server, as the network transport is
  bypassed and the data is read directly from disk. Supported only for GDAL,
  NetCDF, and GRIB data formats.

- ``subsetDomain`` - Specify a subset to be extracted from the input file,
  instead of the full data. The subset should be specified in rasdaman minterval
  format as a string, e.g. ``"[0:100,0:100]"``. Note that the subset domain must
  match in dimensionality with the file dimensionality, and must be accordingly
  offset to the grid origin in the file, which is typically [0,0,0,...].

- ``transpose`` - Specify if x/y should be transposed with an array of 0-based
  axis ids indicating the axes that need to be transposed; the axes must be
  contiguous ``[N,N+1]``, e.g. ``[0,1]``. This is often relevant in NetCDF and
  GRIB data which have a swapped x/y order than what is usually expected in e.g.
  GDAL. Note that transposing axes has a performance penalty, so avoid if
  possible.

- ``formatParameters`` - A JSON object containing extra options which are
  format-specific, specified as string key-value pairs. This is where one would
  specify the base type and domain for decoding a CSV file for example, or GDAL
  format-specific options. Example for a CSV file:

  .. code-block:: json

    "formatParameters": {
      "basetype": "struct { float f, long l }",
      "domain": "[0:100,0:100]"
    }

.. _decode-gdal:

GDAL
^^^^

- ``formatParameters`` - any entries in the formatParameters object are
  forwarded to the specific GDAL driver; consult the `GDAL documentation
  <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__ for the options recognized
  by each particular driver. E.g. for `PNG
  <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/png.html>`__ you could specify, among other
  details, a description metadata field with:

  .. code-block:: json

    "formatParameters": {
      "DESCRIPTION": "Data description..."
    }

- ``configOptions`` - A JSON object containing *configuration options* as string
  key-value pairs; more details in the `GDAL documentation
  <https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html>`__. Example:

  .. code-block:: json

    "configOptions": {
      "GDAL_CACHEMAX": "64",
      ...
    }

- ``openOptions`` - A JSON object containing *open options* as string
  key-value pairs; an option for selecting overview level from the file with,
  e.g. ``"OVERVIEW_LEVEL": "2"``, is available for all formats (`more details
  <https://gdal.org/api/raster_c_api.html?highlight=overview_level#_CPPv410GDALOpenExPKcjPPCKcPPCKcPPCKc>`__);
  further options may be supported by each driver, e.g. for `TIFF
  <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/gtiff.html#open-options>`__;

  .. code-block:: json

    "openOptions": {
      "OVERVIEW_LEVEL": "2",
      "NUM_THREADS": "ALL_CPUS"
    }

  .. note::

    This feature is only available since GDAL 2.0, so if you have an older GDAL
    these options will be ignored.


GRIB
^^^^

- ``internalStructure`` - Describe the internal structure of a GRIB file, namely
  the domains of all messages to be extracted from the file:

  .. code-block:: json

    "internalStructure": {
      "messageDomains": [
        { "msgId": 1, "domain": "[0:0,0:0,0:719,0:360]" },
        { "msgId": 2, "domain": "[0:0,1:1,0:719,0:360]" },
        { "msgId": 3, "domain": "[0:0,2:2,0:719,0:360]" },
        ...
      ]
    }


CSV / JSON
^^^^^^^^^^

The following are mandatory options that have to be specified in the
``formatParameters`` object:

- ``domain`` - The domain of the MDD encoded in the CSV data. It has to match
  the number of cells read from input file, e.g. for
  ``"domain": "[1:5, 0:10, 2:3]"``, there should be 110 numbers in the input
  file.

- ``basetype`` - Atomic or struct base type of the cell values in the CSV data;
  named structs like ``RGBPixel`` are not supported. Examples: ::

    long
    char
    struct { char red, char blue, char green }


Numbers from the input file are read in order of appearance and stored without
any reordering in rasdaman; whitespace plus the following characters are
ignored:

.. code-block:: text

    '{', '}', ',', '"', '\'', '(', ')', '[', ']'


Examples
--------

GDAL
^^^^

The following query loads a TIFF image into collection ``rgb``: ::

    rasql -q 'insert into rgb values decode( $1 )' --file rgb.tif

If you use double quotes for the query string, note that the ``$`` must be
escaped to avoid interpretation by the shell: ::

    rasql -q "insert into rgb values decode( \$1 )" --file rgb.tif

The example below shows directly specifying a file path in the format parameters;
``<[0:0] 1c>`` is a dummy array value which is not relevant in this case, but is
nevertheless mandatory: ::

    UPDATE test_mr SET test_mr[0:255,0:210]
    ASSIGN decode(<[0:0] 1c>, "GDAL",
        "{ \"filePaths\": [\"/home/rasdaman/mr_1.png\"] }")
    WHERE oid(test_mr) = 6145


CSV / JSON
^^^^^^^^^^

Let array ``A`` be a 2x3 array of longs given as a string as follows: ::

    1,2,3,2,1,3

Inserting ``A`` into rasdaman can be done with ::

    insert into A
    values decode($1, "csv", "{ \"formatParameters\": {
          \"domain\": \"[0:1,0:2]\",
          \"basetype\": \"long\" } }")

Further, let ``B`` be an 1x2 array of RGB values given as follows: ::

    {1,2,3},{2,1,3}

Inserting ``B`` into rasdaman can be done by passing it to this query: ::

    insert into B
    values decode($1, "csv", "{ \"formatParameters\": {
          \"domain\": \"[0:0,0:1]",
          \"basetype\": \"struct{char red, char blue, char green}\" } }")

``B`` could just as well be formatted like this with the same effect (note
the line break): ::

    1 2 3
    2 1 3



.. _rasql-encode-function:

Encode for data export
======================

The ``encode()`` function allows encoding an MDD in a particular data format
repre­sent­at­ion; formally, the result will be a 1D char array.


Syntax
------

::

    encode( mddExp , format )

    encode( mddExp , format , formatParameters )


The first parameter is the MDD to be encoded. It must be 2D if encoded to GDAL
formats (PNG, TIFF, JPEG, etc.), while the native rasdaman encoders (NetCDF,
JSON, and CSV) support MDDs of any dimension; note that presently encode to GRIB
is not supported. As not all base types supported by rasdaman (char, octet,
float, etc.) are necessarily supported by each format, care must be taken to
cast the MDD beforehand.

.. _rasql-encode-function-data-format:

Data format
-----------

A mandatory ``format`` must be specified as the second parameter, indicating
the data format to which the MDD will be encoded; allowed values are

- GDAL format identifiers (see output of ``gdalinfo --formats`` or the
  `GDAL documentation <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__);

- a mime-type string, e.g. ``"image/png"``;

- ``"netcdf"`` / ``"application/netcdf"``, ``"csv"`` / ``"text/csv"``, or
  ``"json"`` / ``"application/json"``, for formats natively supported by
  rasdaman.


.. _rasql-encode-format-parameters:

Format parameters
-----------------

Optionally, a format parameters string can be specified as a third parameter,
which allows to control the format encoding. As in the case of decode(), it must
be a valid JSON object. As the format parameters are in quotes, i.e.
``"formatParameters"``, all quotes inside of the ``formatParameters`` need to be
escaped (``\"``). For example,  ``"{ \"transpose\": [0,1] }"`` is the right way
to specify transposition, while  ``"{ "transpose": [0,1] }"`` will lead to
failure.

Common parameters to most or all formats include:

- ``metadata`` - A single string, or an object of string key-value pairs which
  are added as global metadata when encoding.

- ``transpose`` - Specify if x/y should be transposed with an array of 0-based
  axis ids indicating the axes that need to be transposed; the axes must be
  contiguous ``[N,N+1]``, e.g. ``[0,1]``. This is often relevant when encoding
  data with GDAL formats, which was originally imported from NetCDF and
  GRIB files. Note that transposing axes has a performance penalty, so avoid if
  possible.

- ``nodata`` - Specify nodata value(s). If a single number is specified it will
  be applicable to all bands (e.g. ``0``), otherwise an array of numbers for
  each band can be provided (e.g. ``[0,255,255]``). Special floating-point
  constants are supported (case-sensitive): NaN, NaNf, Infinity, -Infinity.

- ``formatParameters`` - A JSON object containing extra options which are
  format-specific, specified as string key-value pairs. This is where one would
  specify the options for controling what separators and values are used in CSV
  encoding for example, or GDAL format-specific options.

GDAL
^^^^

- ``formatParameters`` - any entries in the formatParameters object are
  forwarded to the specific GDAL driver; consult the `GDAL documentation
  <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/index.html>`__ for the options recognized
  by each particular driver. E.g. for `PNG
  <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/png.html>`__ you could specify, among other
  details, a description metadata field with:

  .. code-block:: json

    "formatParameters": {
      "DESCRIPTION": "Data description..."
    }

  Rasdaman itself does not change the default values for these parameters, with
  the following *exceptions*:

  - ``PNG`` - the compression level when encoding to PNG (option ``ZLEVEL``) will
    be set to ``2`` if the user does not specify it explicitly and the result
    array is not of type ``boolean``. The default compression level of ``6`` does
    not offer considerable space savings on typical image results (e.g. around
    10\% lower file size for satellite image), while significantly increasing the
    time to encode, taking up to 3-5x longer.

- ``configOptions`` - A JSON object containing configuration options as string
  key-value pairs; only relevant for GDAL currently, more details in the `GDAL
  documentation <https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html>`__. Example:

  .. code-block:: json

    "configOptions": {
      "GDAL_CACHEMAX": "64", ...
    }

Geo-referencing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``geoReference`` - An object specifying geo-referencing information; either
  "bbox" or "GCPs" must be provided, along with the "crs":

  - ``crs`` - Coordinate Reference System (CRS) in which the coordinates are
    expressed. Any of the CRS representations `acceptable by GDAL
    <https://gdal.org/programs/raster_common_options.html#cmdoption-t_srs>`__
    can be used:

    - Well known names, such as ``"NAD27"``, ``"NAD83"``, ``"WGS84"`` or ``"WGS72"``
    - ``"EPSG:n"``, ``"EPSGA:n"``
    - PROJ.4 definitions
    - OpenGIS Well Known Text
    - ESRI Well Known Text, prefixed with ``"ESRI::"``
    - Spatial References from URLs
    - ``"AUTO:proj_id,unit_id,lon0,lat0"`` indicating OGC WMS auto projections
    - ``"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::n"`` indicating OGC URNs (deprecated by OGC)

  - ``bbox`` - A geographic X/Y bounding box as an object listing the coordinate
    values (as floating-point numbers) for ``xmin``, ``ymin``, ``xmax``, and
    ``ymax`` properties, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: json

      "bbox": {
        "xmin": 0.0,
        "ymin": -1.0,
        "xmax": 1.0,
        "ymax": 2.0
      }

  - ``GCPs`` - Alternative to a ``bbox``, an array of GCPs (Ground Control
    Points) can be specified; see GCPs section in the `GDAL documentation
    <https://gdal.org/user/raster_data_model.html#gcps>`__ for details. Each
    element of the array is an object describing one control point with the
    following properties:

    - ``id`` - optional unique identifier (gets the GCP array index by default);
    - ``info`` - optional text associated with the GCP;
    - ``pixel``, ``line`` - location on the array grid;
    - ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` - georeferenced location with coordinates in the
      specified CRS; "z" is optional (zero by default);


.. _coloring-arrays:

Coloring Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``colorMap`` - Map single-band cell values into 1, 3, or 4-band values. It can
  be done in different ways depending on the specified type:

  - ``values`` - Each pixel is replaced by the entry in the ``colorTable`` where
    the key is the pixel value. In the example below, it means that all pixels with
    value -1 are replaced by [255, 255, 255, 0]. Pixels with values not present in
    the colorTable are not rendered: they are replaced with a color having all
    components set to 0.

    .. code-block:: json

      "colorMap": {
        "type": "values",
        "colorTable": {
          "-1": [255, 255, 255, 0],
          "-0.5": [125, 125, 125, 255],
          "1": [0, 0, 0, 255]
        }
      }

  - ``intervals`` - All pixels with values between two consecutive entries
    are rendered using the color of the first (lower-value) entry. Pixels with
    values equal to or less than the minimum value are rendered with the bottom
    color (and opacity). Pixels with values equal to or greater than the maximum
    value are rendered with the top color and opacity.

    .. code-block:: json

      "colorMap": {
        "type": "intervals",
        "colorTable": {
          "-1": [255, 255, 255, 0],
          "-0.5": [125, 125, 125, 255],
          "1": [0, 0, 0, 255]
        }
      }

    In this case, all pixels with values in the interval (-inf, -0.5) are replaced
    with [255, 255, 255, 0], pixels in the interval [-0.5, 1) are replaced with
    [125, 125, 125, 255], and pixels with value >= 1 are replaced with [0, 0, 0, 255].

  - ``ramp`` - Same as "intervals", but instead of using the color of the lowest
    value entry, linear interpolation between the lowest value entry and highest
    value entry, based on the pixel value, is performed.

    .. code-block:: json

      "colorMap": {
        "type": "ramp",
        "colorTable": {
          "-1": [255, 255, 255, 0],
          "-0.5": [125, 125, 125, 255],
          "1": [0, 0, 0, 255]
        }
      }

    Pixels with value -0.75 are replaced with color [189, 189, 189, 127], because
    they sit in the middle of the distance between -1 and -0.5, so they get, on
    each channel, the color value in the middle.
    The interpolation formula for a pixel of value x, where 2 consecutive entries
    in the colorTable :math:`a, b` with :math:`a \le x \le b`, is:

    .. math::

      resultColor = \frac{b - x}{b - a} * colorTable[b] + \frac{x - a}{b - a} * colorTable[a]

    For the example above, a = -1, x = -0.75, b = -0.5,
    colorTable[a] = [255, 255, 255, 0], colorTable[b] = [125, 125, 125, 255], so:

    .. math::

      resultColor &= \frac{-0.5 + 0.75}{-0.5 + 1} * [255, 255, 255, 0] + \\
                  & \hspace{1.5em} \frac{-0.75 + 1}{-0.5 + 1} * [125, 125, 125, 255] \\
                  &= 0.5 * [255, 255, 255, 0] + 0.5 * [125, 125, 125, 255] \\
                  &= [127, 127, 127, 0] + [62, 62, 62, 127] \\
                  &= [189, 189, 189, 127] \\

    Note the integer division, because the colors are of type unsigned char.

- ``colorPalette`` - Similar to ``colorMap``, however, it allows specifying
  color information on a metadata level, rather than by actually transforming
  array pixel values; for details see the `GDAL documentation
  <https://gdal.org/user/raster_data_model.html#color-table>`__. It is an object
  that contains several optional properties:

  - ``paletteInterp`` - Indicate how the entries in the colorTable should be
    interpreted; allowed values are "Gray", "RGB", "CMYK", "HSL" (default "RGB");

  - ``colorInterp`` - Array of color interpretations for each band; allowed
    values are Undefined, Gray, Palette, Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, Hue, Saturation,
    Lightness, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, YCbCr_Y, YCbCr_Cb, YCbCr_Cr, YCbCr_Cr;

  - ``colorTable`` - Array of arrays, each containing 1, 3, or 4 short values
    (depending on the ``colorInterp``) for each color entry; to associate a
    color with an array cell value, the cell value is used as a subscript into
    the color table (starting from 0).

NetCDF
^^^^^^

The following are mandatory options when encoding to NetCDF:

- ``variables`` -  Specify variable names for each band of the MDD,
  dimension names if they need to be saved as `coordinate variables
  <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf_data_set_components.html#coordinate_variables>`__,
  as well as non-data `grid mapping variables
  <https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.8/cf-conventions.html#grid-mappings-and-projections>`__.
  There are two ways to specify the variables:

  1. An array of strings for each variable name, e.g. ``["var1", "var2"]``;
     no coordinate variables should be specified in this case, as there is no
     way to specify the data for them;

  2. An object of variable name - object pairs, where each object lists the
     following variable details:

     - ``metadata`` - An object of string key-value pairs which are added as
       attributes to the variable;

     - ``type`` - Type of the data values this variable contains relevant (and
       required) for coordinate or non-data variables; allowed values are "byte",
       "char", "short", "ushort", "int", "uint", "float", and "double";

     - ``data`` - An array of data values for the variable relevant (and
       required) only for coordinate variables (as regular variables get
       their data values from the array to be encoded); the number of values
       must match the dimension extent;

     If the variable name is not listed in the ``dimensions`` array and still
     has a ``data`` attribute, then it will be considered to be a non-data
     variable and will not be used for storing MDD band data; the ``data``
     attribute is ignored in this case, so the value for it can be an empty
     JSON array ``[]``.

- ``dimensions`` - An array of names for each dimension, e.g. ``["Lat","Long"]``.

CSV / JSON
^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose we have array ``A = <[0:1,0:1] 0, 1; 2, 3>``. Encoding to CSV by default ::

    select encode(A, "csv") from A

will result in the following output: ::

    {{0, 1}, {2, 3}}

while encoding to JSON with::

    select encode(A, "json") from A

will result in the following output: ::

    [[0, 1], [2, 3]]

Specifying ``inner_outer`` order with ::

    select encode(A, "csv", "{ \"formatParameters\":
                               { \"order\": \"inner_outer\" } }") from A

will result in the following output (left-most dimensions iterate fastest): ::

    {{0, 2}, {1, 3}}

Let ``B`` be an RGB array ``<[0:0,0:1] {0c, 1c, 2c}, {3c, 4c, 5c}>``. Encoding it
to CSV with default order will result in the following output:

    {"0 1 2","3 4 5"}



.. _ql-guide-oids:

******************
Object identifiers
******************

Function ``oid()`` gives access to an array's object identifier (OID). It
returns the local OID of the database array. The input parameter must be
a variable associated with a collection, it cannot be an array
expression. The reason is that ``oid()`` can be applied to only to
persistent arrays which are stored in the database; it cannot be applied
to query result arrays - these are not stored in the database, hence do
not have an OID.

**Syntax**

::

    oid( variable )

**Example**

The following example retrieves the MDD object with local OID 10 of set
``mr``: ::

    select mr
    from mr
    where oid( mr ) = 10

The following example is incorrect as it tries to get an OID from a
non-persistent result array: ::

    select oid( mr * 2 ) -- illegal example: no expressions
    from mr

Fully specified external OIDs are inserted as strings surrounded by
brackets: ::

    select mr
    from mr
    where oid( mr ) = < localhost | RASBASE | 10 >

In that case, the specified system (system name where the database
server runs) and database must match the one used at query execution
time, otherwise query execution will result in an error.


Expressions
===========

**Parentheses**

All operators, constructors, and functions can be nested arbitrarily,
provided that each sub-expression's result type matches the required
type at the position where the sub-expression occurs. This holds without
limitation for all arithmetic, Boolean, and array-valued expressions.
Parentheses can (and should) be used freely if a particular desired
evaluation precedence is needed which does not follow the normal
left-to-right precedence.

**Example**

::

    select (rgb.red + rgb.green + rgb.blue) / 3c
    from rgb


**Operator Precedence Rules**

Sometimes the evaluation sequence of expressions is ambiguous, and the
different evaluation alternatives have differing results. To resolve
this, a set of precedence rules is defined. You will find out that
when­ever operators have their counterpart in programming languages, the
rasdaman precedence rules follow the same rules as are usual there.

Here the list of operators in descending strength of binding:

-  dot ".", trimming, section
-  unary ``-``
-  ``sqrt``, ``sin``, ``cos``, and other unary arithmetic functions
-  ``*``, ``/``
-  ``+``, ``-``
-  ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``!=``, ``=``
-  ``and``
-  ``or``, ``xor``
-  ":" (interval constructor), ``condense``, ``marray``
-  ``overlay``, ``concat``
-  In all remaining cases evaluation is done left to right.

Miscellaneous

rasdaman version
================

Builtin function version() returns a string containing information about
the rasdaman version of the server, and the gcc version used for
compiling it. The following query ::

    select version()

will generate a 1-D array of cell type char containing contents similar
to the following:

.. code-block:: text

    rasdaman 9.6.0 on x86_64-linux-gnu, compiled by g++
    (Ubuntu 5.4.1-2ubuntu1~16.04) 5.4.1 20160904

.. warning::
    The message syntax is not standardized in any way and may
    change in any rasdaman version without notice.

.. _retrieving-object-metadata:

Retrieving Object Metadata
==========================

Sometimes it is desirable to retrieve metadata about a particular array.
To this end, the ``dbinfo()`` function is provided. It returns a 1-D char
array containing a JSON encoding of key array metadata:

-  Object identifier;
-  Base type, mdd type name, set type name;
-  Total size of the array;
-  Number of tiles and further tiling information: tiling scheme, tile
   size (if specified), and tile configuration;
-  Index information: index type, and further details depending on the
   index type.

The output format is described below by way of an example.

**Syntax**

::

    dbinfo( mddExp )

    dbinfo( mddExp , formatParams )


**Example**

.. code-block:: shell

    $ rasql -q 'select dbinfo(c) from mr2 as c' --out string
    {
      "oid": "150529",
      "baseType": "marray <char>",
      "mddTypeName": "GreyImage",
      "setTypeName": "GreySet",
      "tileNo": "1",
      "totalSize": "54016B",
      "tiling": {
        "tilingScheme": "no_tiling",
        "tileSize": "2097152",
        "tileConfiguration": "[0:511,0:511]"
      },
      "index": {
        "type": "rpt_index",
        "indexSize": "0",
        "PCTmax": "4096B",
        "PCTmin": "2048B"
      }
    }


The function supports a string of format parameters as the second argument.
By now the only supported parameter is printTiles.
It can take multiple values: "embedded", "json", "svg".
Example of syntax:

::

	select dbinfo(c, "printtiles=svg") from test_overlap as c

Parameter "printiles=embedded" will print additionally domains of every tile.
::

	$ rasql -q 'select dbinfo(c, "printtiles=embedded") from test_grey as c' --out string
	{
	 "oid": "136193",
	 "baseType": "marray <char, [*:*,*:*]>",
	 "setTypeName": "GreySet",
	 "mddTypeName": "GreyImage",
	 "tileNo": "48",

	 },
	 "index": {
		"type": "rpt_index",
		"PCTmax": "4096",
		"PCTmin": "2048"
	 }
	}

Option "json" will output only the tile domains as a json object.
::

	["[100:149,210:210]","[150:199,0:29]",..."[0:49,30:59]"]

Last option "svg" will output tiles as svg that can be visualised.
Example:
::

	<svg width="array width" height="array height">
		<rect x="100" y="210" width="50" height="1" id="1232"></rect>
		<rect x="150" y="0" width="50" height="30" id="3223"></rect>
		...
	</svg>

.. note::
    This function can only be invoked on persistent MDD objects, not on
    derived (transient) MDDs.

    This function is in beta version. While output syntax is likely to remain
    largely unchanged, invocation syntax is expected to change to something
    like

.. _sec-errors:

************************************************
Arithmetic Errors and Other Exception Situations
************************************************

During query execution, a number of situations can arise which prohibit
to deliver the desired query result or database update effect. If the
server detects such a situation, query execution is aborted, and an
error exception is thrown. In this Section, we classify the errors that
occur and describe each class.

However, we do not go into the details of handling such an exception -
this is the task of the application program, so we refer to the resp.
API Guides.


Overflow
========

**Candidates**

Overflow conditions can occur with ``add_cells`` and induced operations such
as +.

**System Reaction**

The overflow will be silently ignored, producing a result represented by the bit
pattern pruned to the available size. This is in coherence with overflow
handling in performance-oriented programming languages.

**Remedy**

Query coding should avoid potential overflow situations by applying numerical
knowledge - simply said, the same care should be applied as always when dealing
with numerics.

It is worth being aware of the `type coercion rules <type-coercion>` in
rasdaman and `overflow handling in C++
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_arithmetic#Overflows>`__.
The type coercion rules have been crafted to avoid overflow as much as possible,
but of course it remains a possibility. Adding or multiplying two chars for
example is guaranteed to not overflow. However, adding or multyplying two ulongs
would result in a ulong by default, which may not be large enough to hold the
result. Therefore, it may be worth casting to double in this case based on
knowledge about the data.

Checking for overflow with a case statement like the below will not work as
one might expect and is hence not recommended: ::

    case
    when a.longatt1 * a.longatt2 > 2147483647 then 2147483647
    else a.longatt1 * a.longatt2
    end

If ``a.longatt1 * a.longatt2`` overflows, the result is undefined behavior
according to C++ so it is not clear what the result value would be in this case.
It will never be larger than the maximum value of 32-bit signed integer,
however, because that is the result type according to the type coercion rules.
Hence the comparison to 2147483647 (maximum value of 32-bit signed integer) will
never return true.


Illegal operands
================

**Candidates**

Division by zero, non-positive argument to logarithm, negative arguments
to the square root operator, etc. are the well-known candidates for
arithmetic exceptions.

The `IEEE
754 <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4610933>`__
standard lists, for each operation, all invalid input and the
corresponding operation result (Sections :ref:`sec-select-clause-result-prep`,
:ref:`sec-from-clause-coll-spec`, :ref:`sec-mintervals`). Examples
include:

- division(0,0), division(INF,INF)
- sqrt(x) where x < 0
- log(x) where x < 0

**System Reaction**

In operations returning floating point numbers, results are produced in
conformance with IEEE 754. For example, 1/0 results in nan.

In operations returning integer numbers, results for illegal operations
are as follows:

- ``div(x, 0)`` leads to a "division by zero" exception
- ``mod(x, 0)`` leads to a "division by zero" exception

**Remedy**

To avoid an exception the following code is recommended for ``a div b``
(replace accordingly for ``mod``), replacing all illegal situations with a
result of choice, ``c``: ::

    case when b = 0 then c else div(a, b) end

If the particular situation allows, it may be more efficient to cast to
floating-point, and cast back to integer after the division (if an integer
result is wanted): ::

    (long)((double)a / b)

Division by 0 will result in Inf in this case, which turns into 0 when cast to
integer.

===================

If a database has been opened in read-only mode, a write operation will
be refused by the server; "write operation" meaning an insert, update,
or delete statement.


***********************************
Database Retrieval and Manipulation
***********************************

Collection Handling
===================

.. _create-collection:

Create a Collection
-------------------

The create collection statement is used to create a new, empty MDD
collection by specifying its name and type. The type must exist in the
database schema. There must not be another collection in this database
bearing the name indicated.

**Syntax**

::

    create collection collName typeName

**Example**

::

    create collection mr GreySet


.. _drop-collection:

Drop a Collection
-----------------

A database collection can be deleted using the ``drop collection`` statement.

**Syntax**

::

    drop collection collName

**Example**

::

    drop collection mr1


.. _alter-collection:

Alter Collection
----------------

The type of a collection can be changed using the ``alter collection`` statement.
The new collection type is accordingly checked for compatibility (same cell type,
dimensionality) as the existing type of the collection before setting it.

**Syntax**

::

    alter collection collName
    set type newCollType

**Example**

::

    alter collection mr2
    set type GreySetWithNullValues

.. _retrieve-all-collection-names:

Retrieve All Collection Names
-----------------------------

.. include:: 04_ql-guide-collnames.inc


Select
======

The select statement allows for the retrieval from array collections.
The result is a set (collection) of items whose structure is defined in
the select clause. Result items can be arrays, atomic values, or
structs. In the where clause, a condition can be expressed which acts as
a filter for the result set. A single query can address several
collections.

**Syntax**

::

    select resultList
    from collName [ as collIterator ]
         [, collName [ as collIterator ] ] ...

    select resultList
    from collName [ as collIterator ]
         [, collName [ as collIterator ] ] ...
    where booleanExp


**Examples**

This query delivers a set of grayscale images: ::

    select mr[100:150,40:80] / 2
    from mr
    where some_cells( mr[120:160, 55:75] > 250 )

This query, on the other hand, delivers a set of integers: ::

    select count_cells( mr[120:160, 55:75] > 250 )
    from mr

Finally, this query delivers a set of **struct**\ s, each one with an
integer and a 2-D array component: ::

    select struct { max_cells( a ), a }
    from mr as a

.. _sec-insert:

Insert
======

MDD objects can be inserted into database collections using the
**insert** statement. The array to be inserted must conform with the
collection's type definition concerning both cell type and spatial
domain. One or more variable bounds in the collection's array type
definition allow degrees of freedom for the array to be inserted. Hence,
the resulting collection in this case can contain arrays with different
spatial domain.

**Syntax**

::

    insert into collName
    values mddExp

*collName* specifies the name of the target set, *mddExp* describes the
array to be inserted.

**Example**

Add a black image to collection mr1. ::

    insert into mr1
    values marray x in [ 0:255, 0:210 ]
    values 0c


See the programming interfaces described in the
*rasdaman Developer's Guides* on how to ship external array data to the
server using ``insert`` and ``update`` statements.

.. _sec-update:

Update
======

The **update** statement allows to manipulate arrays of a collection.
Which elements of the collection are affected can be determined with the
**where** clause; by indicating a particular OID, single arrays can be
updated.

An update can be *complete* in that the whole array is replaced or
*partial*, i.e., only part of the database array is changed. Only those
array cells are affected the spatial domain of the replacement
expression on the right-hand side of the ``set`` clause. Pixel locations are
matched pairwise according to the arrays' spatial domains. Therefore, to
appropriately position the replacement array, application of the ``shift()``
function (see :ref:`sec-shift`) can be necessary; for more details and practical
examples continue to :ref:`sec-update-partial`.

As a rule, the spatial domain of the righthand side expression must be
equal to or a subset of the database array's spatial domain.

Cell values contained in the update null set will *not* overwrite existing
cell values which are not null. The update null set is taken from the source
MDD if it is not empty, otherwise it will be taken from the target MDD.

.. _sec-update-syntax:

**Syntax**

::

    update collName as collIterator
    set    updateSpec assign mddExp

    update collName as collIterator
    set    updateSpec assign mddExp
    where  booleanExp

where *updateSpec* can optionally contain a restricting minterval (see
examples further below): ::

    var
    var [ mintervalExp ]

Each element of the set named *collName* which fulfils the selection
predicate *booleanEpxr* gets assigned the result of *mddExp*. The
right-hand side mddExp overwrites the corresponding area in the
collection element; note that no automatic shifting takes place: the
spatial domain of mddExp determines the very place where to put it.

If you want to include existing data from the database in *mddExp*, then this
needs to be specified in an additional ``from`` clause, just like in normal
``select`` queries. The syntax in this case is ::

    update collName as collIterator
    set    updateSpec assign mddExp
    from   existingCollName [ as collIterator ]
           [, existingCollName [ as collIterator ] ] ...
    where  booleanExp

**Example**

An arrow marker is put into the image in collection ``mr2``. The appropriate
part of ``a`` is selected and added to the arrow image which, for
simplicity, is assumed to have the appropriate spatial domain.

.. _figure17:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image9.png
   :align: center
   :width: 211px

   Original image of collection ``mr2``

::

    update mr2 as a
    set a assign a[0 : 179 , 0:54] + $1/2c

The argument $1 is the arrow image (\ :numref:`figure18`\ ) which has to be shipped
to the server along with the query. It is an image showing a white arrow
on a black background. For more information on the use of $ variables
you may want to consult the language binding guides of the rasdaman
Documentation Set.

.. _figure18:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image26.png

   Arrow used for updating


Looking up the **mr2** collection after executing the update yields the
result as shown in :numref:`figure19`:

.. _figure19:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image27.png
   :align: center
   :width: 211px

   Updated collection mr2


.. note::

    The replacement expression and the MDD to be updated (i.e., left and
    right-hand side of the **assign** clause) in the above example must have
    the same dimensionality. Updating a (lower-dimensional) section of an
    MDDs can be achieved through a section operator indicating the "slice"
    to be modified. The following query appends one line to a fax (which is
    assumed to be extensible in the second dimension):

    ::

        update fax as f
        set f[ *:* , sdom(f)[1].hi+1 ] assign $1

The example below updates target collection ``mr2`` with data from ``rgb``
(collection that exists already in the database): ::

    update mr2 as a
    set a assign b[ 0:150, 50:200 ].red
    from rgb as b


.. _sec-update-partial:

Partial Updates
---------------

Often very large data files need to be inserted in rasdaman, which don't fit in
main memory. One way to insert such a large file is to split it into smaller
parts, and then import each part one by one via partial updates, until the
initial image is reconstructed in rasdaman.

This is done in two steps: initializing an MDD in a collection, and inserting
each part in this MDD.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Updates replace an area in a target MDD object with the data from a source MDD
object, so first the target MDD object needs to be initialized in a collection.
To initialize an MDD object it's sufficient to insert an MDD object of size 1 (a
single point) to the collection:

::

    insert into Coll
    values marray it in [0:0,0:0,...] values 0

Note that the MDD constructed with the marray constructor should match the type
of Coll (dimension and base type). If the dimension of the data matches the Coll
dimensions (e.g. both are 3D),  then inserting some part of the data would work
as well. Otherwise, if data is 2D and Coll is 3D for example, it is necessary to
initialize an array in the above way.

Updates
^^^^^^^

After we have an MDD initialized in the collection, we can continue with
updating it with the individual parts using the update statement in rasql.

Refering to the `update statement syntax <sec-update-syntax>`__, ``mddExp`` can
be any expression that results in an MDD object M, like an marray construct, a
format conversion function, etc. The position where M will be placed in the
target MDD (``collIterator``) is determined by the spatial domain of M. When
importing data in some format via the decode function, by default the resulting
MDD has an sdom of ``[0:width,0:height,..]``, which will place M at ``[0,0,..]``
in the target MDD. In order to place it in a different position, the spatial
domain of M has to be explicitly set with the shift function in the query. For
example:

::

  update Coll as c set c
  assign shift(decode($1),[100,100])

The update statement allows one to dynamically expand MDDs (up to the limits of
the MDD type if any have been specified), so it's not necessary to fully
materialize an MDD.

When the MDD is first initialized with:

::

    insert into Coll
    values marray it in [0:0,0:0,...] values 0

it has a spatial domain of ``[0:0,0:0,...]`` and only one point is materialized
in the database. Updating this MDD later on, further expands the spatial domain
if the source array M extends outside the sdom of target array T.

Example: 3D timeseries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a 3D collection first for arrays of type float: ::

    create collection Coll FloatSet3

Initialize an array with a single cell in the collection: ::

    insert into Coll
    values marray it in [0:0,0:0,0:0] values 0f

Update array with data at the first time slice: ::

    update Coll as c set c[0,*:*,*:*]
    assign decode($1)

Update array with data at the second time slice, but shift spatially to
``[10,1]``: ::

    update Coll as c set c[1,*:*,*:*]
    assign shift( decode($1), [10,1] )

And so on.

Example: 3D cube of multiple 3D arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this case we build a 3D cube by concatenating multiple smaller 3D cubes along
a certain dimension, i.e. build a 3D mosaic.

Create the 3D collection first (suppose it's for arrays of type float): ::

    create collection Coll FloatSet3

Initialize an array with a single cell in the collection: ::

    insert into Coll
    values marray it in [0:0,0:0,0:0] values 0f

Update array with the first cube, which has itself sdom ``[0:3,0:100,0:100]``: ::

    update Coll as c set c[0:3,0:100,0:100]
    assign decode($1, "netcdf")

After this Coll has sdom ``[0:3,0:100,0:100]``.

Update array with the second cube, which has itself sdom ``[0:5,0:100,0:100]``;
note that now we want to place this one on top of the first one with respect to
the first dimension, so its origin must be shifted by 5 so that its sdom will be
in effect ``[5:10,0:100,0:100]``: ::

    update Coll as c set c[5:10,0:100,0:100]
    assign shift(decode($1, "netcdf"), [5,0,0])

The sdom of Coll is now ``[0:10,0:100,0:100]``.

Update array with the third cube, which has itself sdom ``[0:2,0:100,0:100]``;
note that now we want to place this one next to the first two with respect to
the second dimension and a bit higher by 5 pixels, so that its sdom will be in
effect ``[5:7,100:200,0:100]``: ::

    update Coll as c set c[5:7,100:200,0:100]
    assign shift(decode($1, "netcdf"), [5,100,0])

The sdom of Coll is now ``[0:10,100:200,0:100]``.

.. _sec-delete:

Delete
======

Arrays are deleted from a database collection using the **delete**
statement. The arrays to be removed from a collection can be further
characterized in an optional **where** clause. If the condition is
omitted, all elements will be deleted so that the collection will be
empty afterwards.

**Syntax**

::

    delete from collName [ as collIterator ]
    [ where booleanExp ]


**Example**

::

    delete from mr1 as a
    where all_cells( a < 30 )


This will delete all "very dark" images of collection ``mr1`` with all pixel
values lower than 30.


**********************
Transaction Scheduling
**********************

Since rasdaman 9.0, database transactions lock arrays on fine-grain
level. This prevents clients from changing array areas currently being
modified by another client.


Locking
=======

Lock compatibility is as expected: read access involves shared ("S")
locks which are mutually compatible while write access imposes an
exclusive lock ("X") which prohibits any other access:

+---+----+----+
|   | S  | X  |
+---+----+----+
| S | \+ | \- |
+---+----+----+
| X | \- | \- |
+---+----+----+

Shared locks are set by ``SELECT`` queries, exclusive ones in ``INSERT``,
``UPDATE``, and ``DELETE`` queries.

Locks are acquired by queries dynamically as needed during a
trans­action. All locks are held until the end of the transaction, and
then released collectively [15]_.


Lock Granularity
================

The unit of locking is a tile, as tiles also form the unit of access to
persistent storage.


Conflict Behavior
=================

If a transaction attempts to acquire a lock on a tile which has an
incompatible lock it will abort with a message similar to the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Error: One or more of the target tiles are locked by another
    transaction.

Only the query will return with an exception, the rasdaman transaction
as such is not affected. It is up to the application program to catch
the exception and react properly, depending on the particular intended
behaviour.


Lock Federation
===============

Locks are maintained in the PostgreSQL database in which rasdaman stores
data. Therefore, all rasserver processes accessing the same RASBASE get
synchronized.

.. _examples-2:


Examples
========

The following two SELECT queries can be run concurrently against the
same database:

.. code-block:: shell

    rasql -q "select mr[0:10,0:10] from mr"

    rasql -q "select mr[5:10,5:10] from mr"

The following two UPDATE queries can run concurrently as well, as they
address different collections:

.. code-block:: shell

    rasql -q "update mr set mr[0:10,0:10] \
              assign marray x in [0:10,0:10] values 127c" \
          --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

    rasql -q "update mr2 set mr2[0:5,0:5] \
              assign marray x in [0:5,0:5] values 65c" \
          --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

From the following two queries, one will fail (the one which happens to
arrive later) because the address the same tile:

.. code-block:: shell

    rasql -q "update mr set mr[0:10,0:10] assign \
              marray x in [0:10,0:10] values 127c" \
          --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

    rasql -q "update mr set mr[0:5,0:5] assign \
              marray x in [0:5,0:5] values 65c" \
          --user rasadmin --passwd rasadmin

.. _limitations-1:


Limitations
===========

Currently, only tiles are locked, not other entities like indexes.

.. _sec-linking-mdd:

***************************
Linking MDD with Other Data
***************************

Purpose of OIDs
===============

Each array instance and each collection in a rasdaman database has a
identifier which is unique within a database. In the case of a
collection this is the collection name and an object identifier (OID),
whereas for an array this is only the OID. OIDs are generated by the
system upon creation of an array instance, they do not change over an
array's lifetime, and OIDs of deleted arrays will never be reassigned to
other arrays. This way, OIDs form the means to unambiguously identifiy a
particular array. OIDs can be used several ways:

-  In rasql, OIDs of arrays can be retrieved and displayed, and they can
   be used as selection conditions in the condition part.

-  OIDs form the means to establish references from objects or tuples
   residing in other databases systems to rasdaman arrays. Please refer
   for further information to the language-specific *rasdaman
   Developer's Guides* and the *rasdaman External Products Integration
   Guide* available for each database system to which rasdaman
   interfaces.

Due to the very different referencing mechanisms used in current
database technology, there cannot be one single mechanism. Instead,
rasdaman employs its own identification scheme which, then, is combined
with the target DBMS way of referencing. See :ref:`sec-oid-constants` of this
document as well as the *rasdaman External Products Integration Guide*
for further information.

.. _collection-names-1:


Collection Names
================

MDD collections are named. The name is indicated by the user or the
application program upon creation of the collection; it must be unique
within the given database. The most typical usage forms of collection
names are

-  as a reference in the from clause of a rasql query

-  their storage in an attribute of a base DBMS object or tuple, thereby
   establishing a reference (also called foreign key or pointer).

Array Object identifiers
========================

Each MDD array is world-wide uniquely identified by its object
identifier (OID). An OID consists of three components:

-  A string containing the system where the database resides (system
   name),

-  A string containing the database (base name), and

-  A number containing the local object id within the database.

The main purposes of OIDs are

-  to establish references from the outside world to arrays and

-  to identify a particular array by indicating one OID or an OID list
   in the search condition of a query.


.. _storage-layout:

***********************
Storage Layout Language
***********************

.. _overview-2:

Overview
========

**Tiling**

To handle arbitrarily large arrays, rasdaman introduces the concept of
*tiling* them, that is: partitioning a large array into smaller,
non-overlapping sub-arrays which act as the unit of storage access
during query eval­uat­ion. To the query client, tiling remains
invisible, hence it constitutes a tun­ing parameter which allows
database designers and administrators to adapt database storage layout
to specific query patterns and workloads.

To this end, rasdaman offers a storage layout language for arrays which
embeds into the query language and gives users comfortable, yet concise
control over important physical tuning parameters. Further, this
sub-language wraps several strategies which turn out useful in face of
massive spatio-temporal data sets.

Tiling can be categorized into aligned and non-aligned (\ :numref:`figure20`\ ).A
tiling is *aligned* if tiles are defined through axis-parallel
hyperplanes cutting all through the domain. Aligned tiling is further
classified into *regular* and *aligned irregular* depending on whether
the parallel hyperplanes are equidistant (except possibly for border
tiles) or not. The special case of equally sized tile edges in all
directions is called *cubed*.

.. _figure20:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image28.png
   :align: center

   Types of tilings



Non-aligned tiling contains tiles whose faces are not aligned with those
of their neighbors. This can be *partially aligned* with still some
hyperplanes shared or *totally non-aligned* with no such sharing at all.

**Syntax**

We use a BNF variant where optional elements are indicated as ::

    ( ... )?

to clearly distinguish them from the "[" and "]" terminals.

**Tiling Through API**

In the rasdaman C++ API (cf. C++ Guide), this functionality is available
through a specific hierarchy of classes.

**Introductory Example**

The following example illustrates the overall syntax extension which the
storage layout sublanguage adds to the **insert** statement: ::

    insert into MyCollection
    values ...
    tiling
        area of interest [0:20,0:40],[45:80,80:85]
        tile size 1000000


General Tiling Parameters
=========================

**Maximum Tile Size**

The optional **tile size** parameter allows specifying a maximum tile
size; irrespective of the algorithm employed to obtain a particular tile
shape, its size will never exceed the maximum indicated in this
parameter.

**Syntax:**

::

    tile size t

where *t* indicates the tile size in bytes.

If nothing is known about the access patterns, tile size allows
stream­lining array tiling to architectural parameters of the server,
such as DMA bandwidth and disk speed.

**Tile Configuration**

A tile configuration is a list of bounding boxes specified by their
extent. No position is indicated, as it is the shape of the box which
will be used to define the tiling, according to various strategies.

**Syntax:**

::

    [ integerLit , ... , integerLit ]

For a ``d``-dimensional MDD, the tile configuration consists of a vector
of ``d`` elements where the *i*\ :sup:`th` vector specifies the tile
extent in dimension *i*, for 0\le\ *i*\ <``d``. Each number indicates the
tile extent in cells along the corresp­ond­ing dimension.

For example, a tile configuration ``[100, 100, 1000]`` for a 3-D MDD states
that tiles should have an extent of 100 cells in dimension 0 and 1, and
an extent of 1,000 cells in dimension 2. In image timeseries analysis,
such a stretching tiles along the time axis speeds up temporal analysis.


Regular Tiling
==============

**Concept**

Regular tiling applies when there is some varying degree of knowledge
about the subsetting patterns arriving with queries. We may or may not
know the lower corner of the request box, the size of the box, or the
shape (i.e., edge size ratio) of the box. For example, map viewing
clients typically send several requests of fixed extent per mouse click
to maintain a cache of tiles in the browser for faster panning. So the
extent of the tile is known -- or at least that tiles are quadratic. The
absolute location often is not known, unless the client is kind enough
to always request areas only in one fixed tile size and with starting
points in multiples of the tile edge length.If additionally the
configuration follows a uniform probability distrib­ut­ion then a cubed
tiling is optimal.

In the storage directive, regular tiling is specified by providing a
bounding box list, *TileConf*, and an optional maximum tile size:

**Syntax**

::

    tiling regular TileConf ( tile size integerLit )?


**Example**

This line below dictates, for a 2-D MDD, tiles to be of size 1024 x
1024, except for border tiles (which can be smaller): ::

    tiling regular [ 1024 , 1024 ]


Aligned Tiling
==============

**Concept**

Generalizing from regular tiling, we may not know a good tile shape for
all dimensions, but only some of them. An axis *p*\ \in { 1, ..., d } which
never participates in any subsetting box is called a *preferred* (or
*pre­fer­ential*) *direction of access* and denoted as *tc*\ :sub:`p` =
\*. An optimal tile structure in this situation extends to the array
bounds in the preferential directions.

Practical use cases include satellite image time series stacks over some
reg­ion. Grossly simplified, during analysis there are two distinguished
acc­ess patterns (notwithstanding that others occur sometimes as well):
either a time slice is read, corresponding to *tc* = (\*, \*, t) for some
given time instance *t*, or a time series is extracted for one particular
position (*x*, *y*) on the earth surface; this corresponds to
*tc* = ( *x*, *y*, \*). The aligned tiling alg­or­ithm creates tiles as
large as possible based on the constraints that (i) tile pro­portions
adhere to tc and (ii) all tiles have the same size. The upper array
limits constitute an exception: for filling the remaining gap (which
us­ually occurs) tiles can be smaller and deviate from the
con­fig­ur­ation siz­ings. :numref:`figure21` illustrates aligned tiling with two
examples, for configuration *tc* = (1, 2) (left) and for *tc* =(1, 3, 4)
(right).

.. _figure21:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image29.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 80%

   Aligned tiling examples

Preferential access is illustrated in :numref:`figure22`. Left, access is
performed along preferential directions 1 and 2, corresponding to
configuration *tc* = (\*, \*, 1). The tiling tothe right supports
configuration *tc* = (4, 1, \*) with preferred axis 3.

.. _figure22:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/image30.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%

   Aligned tiling examples with preferential access directions

The aligned tiling construction consists of two steps. First, a concrete
tile shape is determined. After that, the extent of all tiles is
calculated by iterating over the array's complete domain. In presence of
more than one preferred directions - i.e., with a configuration
containing more than one "*" values - axes are prioritized in descending
order. This exploits the fact that array linearization is performed in a
way that the "outermost loop" is the first dimension and the "innermost
loop" the last. Hence, by clustering along higher coordinate axes a
better spatial clustering is achieved.

**Syntax**

::

    tiling aligned TileConf ( tile size IntLit )?


**Example**

The following clause accommodates map clients fetching quadratic images
known to be no more than 512 x 512 x 3 = 786,432 bytes: ::

    tiling aligned [1,1] tile size 786432

.. important::
    Aligned tiling is the default strategy in rasdaman.


Directional Tiling
==================

**Concept**

Sometimes the application semantics prescribes access in well-known
coordinate intervals. In OLAP, such intervals are given by the semantic
categories of the measures as defined by the dimension hierarchies, such
as product categories which are defined for the exact purpose of
accessing them group-wise in queries. Similar effects can occur with
spatio-temporal data where, for example, a time axis may suggest access
in units of days, weeks, or years. In rasdaman, if bounding boxes are
well known then spatial access may be approximated by those; if they are
overlapping then this is a case for area-of-interest tiling (see below),
if not then directional tiling can be applied.

The tiling corresponding to such a partition is given by its Cartesian
product. :numref:`figure23` shows such a structure for the 2-D and 3-D case.

To construct it, the partition vectors are used to span the Cartesian
product first. Should one of the resulting tiles exceed the size limit,
as it happens in the tiles marked with a "*" in :numref:`figure23`, then a
so-called sub-tiling takes place. Sub-tiling applies regular tiling by
introducing additional local cutting hyperplanes. As these hyperplanes
do not stretch through all tiles the resulting tiling in general is not
regular. The resulting tile set guarantees that for answering queries
using one of the subsetting patterns in part, or any union of these
patterns, only those cells are read which will be delivered in the
response. Further, if the area requested is smaller than the tile size
limit then only one tile needs to be accessed.

.. _figure23:

.. figure:: media/ql-guide/figureb.png
   :align: center

   Directional tiling

Sometimes axes do not have categories associated. One possible reason is
that subsetting is never performed along this axis, for example in an
image time series where slicing is done along the time axis while the
x/y image planes always are read in total. Similarly, for importing 4-D
climate data into a GIS a query might always slice at the lowest
atmospheric layer and at the most current time available without
additional trimming in the horizontal axes.

We call such axes *preferred access directions* in the context of a
directional tiling; they are identified by empty partitions. To
accommodate this intention expressed by the user the sub-tiling strategy
changes: no longer is regular tiling applied, which would introduce
undesirable cuts along the preferred axis, but rather are subdividing
hyperplanes constructed parallel to the preference axis. This allows
accommodating the tile size maximum while, at the same time, keeping the
number of tiles accessed in preference direction at a minimum.

In :numref:`figure24`, a 3-D cube is first split by way of directional tiling
(left). One tile is larger than the maximum allowed, hence sub-tiling
starts (center). It recognizes that axes 0 and 2 are preferred and,
hence, splits only along dimension 1. The result (right) is such that
subsetting along the preferred axes - i.e., with a trim or slice
specification only in dimension 1 - can always be accommodated with a
single tile read.

   Directional tiling of a 3-D cube with one degree of freedom

**Syntax**

::

    tiling directional splitList
    ( with subtiling ( tile size integerLit)? )?

where *splitList* is a list of split vectors (t\ :sub:`1,1`; ...;
t\ :sub:`1,n1`),...,(t\ :sub:`d,1`; ...; t\ :sub:`d,nd`). Each split vector
consists of an ascendingly ordered list of split points for the tiling
algorithm, or an asterisk "*" for a preferred axis. The split vectors
are positional, applying to the dimension axes of the array in order of
appearance.

**Example**

The following defines a directional tiling with split vectors (0; 512;
1024) and (0; 15; 200) for axes 0 and 2, respectively, with dimension 1
as a pre­ferred axis: ::

    tiling directional [0,512,1024], [], [0,15,200]


Area of Interest Tiling
=======================

**Concept**

An *area of interest* is a frequently accessed sub-array of an array
object. An area-of-interest pattern, consequently, consists of a set of
domains accessed with an access probability significantly higher than
that of all other possible patterns. Goal is to achieve a tiling which
optimizes access to these preferred patterns; performance of all other
patterns is ignored.

These areas of interest do not have to fully cover the array, and the
may overlap. The system will establish an optimal disjoint partitioning
for the given boxes in a way that the amount of data and the number of
tiles accessed for retrieval of any area of interest are minimized. More
exactly, it is guaranteed that accessing an area of interest only reads
data be­long­ing to this area.

:numref:`figure25` gives an intuition of how the algorithm works. Given some
area-of-interest set (a), the algorithm first partitions using
directional tiling based on the partition boundaries (b). By
construction, each of the resulting tiles (c) contains only cells which
all share the same areas of interest, or none at all. As this introduces
fragmentation, a merge step follows where adjacent partitions
overlapping with the same areas of interest are combined. Often there is
more than one choice to perform merging; the algorithm is inherently
nondeterministic. Rasdaman exploits this degree of freedom and cluster
tiles in sequence of dimensions, as this represents the
sequentialization pattern on disk and, hence, is the best choice for
maintaining spatial clustering on disk (d,e). In a final step,
sub-tiling is performed on the partitions as necessary, depending on the
tile size limit. In contrast to the directional tiling algorithm, an
aligned tiling strategy is pursued here making use of the tile
configuration argument, tc. As this does not change anything in our
example, the final result (f) is unchanged over (e).

   Steps in performing area of interest tiling**



**Syntax**

::

    tiling area of interest tileConf ( tile size integerLit )?


**Example**

::

    tiling area of interest
    [0:20,0:40],[945:980,980:985],[10:1000,10:1000]


Tiling statistic
================

**Concept**

Area of interest tiling requires enumeration of a set of clearly
delineated areas. Sometimes, however, retrieval does not follow such a
focused pattern set, but rather shows some random behavior oscillating
around hot spots. This can occur, for example, when using a pointing
device in a Web GIS: while many users possibly want to see some "hot"
area, coordinates sub­mitted will differ to some extent. We call such a
pattern multiple acc­ess­es to areas of interest. Area of interest
tiling can lead to significant dis­advantages in such a situation. If
the actual request box is contained in some area of interest then the
corresponding tiles will have to be pruned from pixels outside the
request box; this requires a selective copying which is significantly
slower than a simple memcpy(). More important, how­ever, is a request
box going slightly over the boundaries of the area of int­erest - in
this case, an additional tile has to be read from which only a small
portion will be actually used. Disastrous, finally, is the output of the
area-of-interest tiling, as an immense number of tiny tiles will be
gen­er­at­ed for all the slight area variations, leading to costly
merging during requ­ests.

This motivates a tiling strategy which accounts for statistically
blurred access patterns. The statistic tiling algorithm re­ceiv­es a
list of access patterns plus border and frequency thresholds. The
algorithm condenses this list into a smallish set of patterns by
group­ing them according to sim­il­ar­ity. This process is guarded by
the two thresh­olds. The border thresh­old determines from what maximum
diff­er­ence on two areas are considered separately. It is measured in
number of cells to make it indep­end­ent from area geometry. The result
is a reduced set of areas, each ass­ociated with a frequency of
occurrence. In a second run, those areas are filtered out which fall
below the frequency threshold. Having calculated such re­pres­ent­ative
areas, the algorithm performs an area of interest tiling on these.

This method has the potential of reducing overall access costs provided
thresholds are placed wisely. Log analysis tools can provide estimates
for guidance. In the storage directive, statistical tiling receives a
list of areas plus, optionally, the two thresholds and a tile size
limit.

**Syntax**

::

    tiling statistic tileConf
    ( tile size integerLit )?
    ( border threshold integerLit)?
    ( interest threshold floatLit)?


**Example**

The following example specifies two areas, a border threshold of 50 and
an interest probability threshold of 30%: ::

    tiling statistic [0:20,0:40],[30:50,70:90]
    border threshold 50
    interest threshold 0.3


Summary: Tiling Guidelines
==========================

This section summarizes rules of thumb for a good tiling. However, a
thorough evaluation of the query access pattern, either empirically
through server log inspection or theoretically by considering
application logics, is strongly recommended, as it typically offers a
potential for substantial improvements over the standard heuristics.

-  **Nothing is known about access patterns:** choose regular tiling
   with a maximum tile size; on PC-type architectures, tile sizes of about
   4-5 MB have yielded good results.

-  **Trim intervals in direction x are n times more frequent than in
   direction y and z together:** choose directional tiling where the
   ratios are approximately x\*n=y\*z. Specify a maximum tile size.

-  **Hot spots (i.e., their bounding boxes) are known:** choose Area of
   Interest tiling on these bounding boxes.

Web Access to rasql
*******************

.. _overview-3:

Overview
========

As part of petascope, the geo service frontend to rasdaman, Web access
to rasql is provided. The request format is described in :ref:`sec-req-format`,
the response format in :ref:`sec-resp-format` below.

Service Endpoint
================

The service endpoint for rasql queries is

.. code-block:: text

    http://{service}/{path}/rasdaman/rasql

.. _sec-req-format:

Request Format
==============

A request is sent as an http GET URL with the query as key-value pair
parameter. By default, the rasdaman login is taken from the petascope
settings in ``petascope.properties``; optionally, another valid rasdaman
user name and password can be provided as additional parameters.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: text

    http://{service}/{path}/rasdaman/rasql?params

This servlet endpoint accepts KVP requests with the following
parameters:

query=q
    where *q* is a valid rasql query, appropriately escaped as
    per http specification.

username=u
    where *u* is the user name for logging into rasdaman
    (optional, default: value of variable ``rasdaman_user``
    in ``petascope.properties``)

password=p
    where *p* is the password for logging into rasdaman
    (optional, default: value of variable ``rasdaman_pass``
    in ``petascope.properties``)

**Example**

The following URL sends a query request to a fictitious server www.acme.com:

.. code-block:: text

    http://www.acme.com/rasdaman?
        query=select%20rgb.red+rgb.green%20from%20rgb
        &username=rasguest
        &password=rasguest

Since v10, this servlet endpoint can accept the credentials
for ``username:password`` in basic authentication headers and ``POST`` protocol,
for example using ``curl`` tool:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -u rasguest:rasguest
         -d 'query=select 1 + 15 from test_mr as c'
         'http://localhost:8080/rasdaman/rasql'


If results from rasql server are multiple objects
(e.g: ``SELECT .. FROM RAS_*`` or a collection contains multiple arrays),
then they are written in ``multipart/related`` MIME format with ``End``
string as **multipart boundary**. Below is an example
from ``SELECT c from RAS_COLLECTIONNAMES as c``:

.. hidden-code-block:: text

    --End
    Content-type: text/plain

    rgb
    --End
    Content-type: text/plain

    mr
    --End
    Content-type: text/plain

    mr2
    --End--

Clients need to parse the **multipart** results for these cases. There are
some useful libraries to do that,
e.g. `NodeJS with Mailparser <https://nodemailer.com/extras/mailparser/>`__.


.. _sec-resp-format:

Response Format
===============

The response to a rasdaman query gets wrapped into a http message. The
response format is as follows, depending on the nature of the result:

If the query returns arrays, then the MIME type of the response is
``application/octet-stream``.

-  If the result is empty, the document will be empty.

-  If the result consists of one array object, then this object will be
   delivered as is.

-  If the result consists of several array objects, then the response
   will consist of a Multipart/MIME document.

-  If the query returns scalars, all scalars will be delivered in one
   document of MIME type ``text/plain``, separated by whitespace.


Security
========

User and password are expected in cleartext, so do not use this tool in
security sensitive contexts.

The service endpoint ``rasdaman/rasql``, being part of the petascope
servlet, can be disabled in the servlet container's setup (such as
Tomcat).

.. _limitations-2:


Limitations
===========

Currently, no uploading of data to the server is supported. Hence,
functionality is restricted to queries without positional parameters ``$1``,
``$2``, etc.

Currently, array responses returned invariably have the same MIME type,
``application/octet-stream``. In future it is foreseen to adjust the MIME
type to the identifier of the specific file format as chosen in the
``encode()`` function.

Appendix A: rasql Grammar
*************************

This appendix presents a simplified list of the main rasql grammar rules
used in the rasdaman system. The grammar is described as a set of
production rules. Each rule consists of a non-terminal on the left-hand
side of the colon operator and a list of symbol names on the right-hand
side. The vertical bar ``|`` introduces a rule with the same left-hand
side as the previous one. It is usually read as *or*. Symbol names can
either be non-terminals or terminals (the former ones printed in bold
face as a link which can be followed to the non-terminal production).
Terminals represent keywords of the language, or identifiers, or
number literals; "``(``", "``)``", "``[``", and "``]``" are also terminals, but
they are in double quotes to distinguish them from the grammar parentheses
(used to group alternatives) or brackets (used to indicate optional parts).
