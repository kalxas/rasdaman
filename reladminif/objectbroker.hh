the ObjectBroker is one of the three columns one which the persistence layer rests:
ObjectBroker, DBRef, DBObject.
the ObjectBroker keeps track of all persistent objects which are loaded into memory.
objects register themselves at this facility and deregister themselves when they are
deleted.

The ObjectBroker supplies functionality for accessing persistent objects by oid and by
name.
The ObjectBroker can be configured to serve as a cross transaction cache.
The ObjectBroker can retrieve the oids of all objects of a specific type which are stored
in the database.
The list of objects which are kept by the ObjectBroker are cleared by TransactionIf.
